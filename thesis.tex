\section{Arctic Ocean}
\label{arcticocean}


Despite its small size (only $3\%$ of the Earth's surface), the Arctic
Ocean is a disproportionately important part of the global ocean and has the potential
to affect the world's climate in major ways. Located above
$70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$, the Arctic is characterised by its seasonally
varying ice cap. This ice cap, along with its counterpart in the
Antarctic, is a major contribution to the planet's albedo as well as being
a huge reservoir of freshwater. The Arctic Ocean is a key component
in how the polar ice cap interacts with the climate and, in turn, how
the climate affects the ice cap. 
The Arctic itself is a highly stable body of water with strong stratification, 
which means that the water column can be divided into advective water masses.
The Arctic Ocean is commonly divided into four different layers (\figref{fig:amap}):
The polar mixed layer, which is a well mixed layer in
contact with the atmosphere and surface ice; the halocline, a
reservoir of fresh water and penetrates to around $200\,\mathrm{m}$, which acts
as a buffer between the sea ice and the \gls{awl}; the \gls{awl},
which is body of warm salty water which originates from the North Atlantic and Nordic 
Sea via Fram Strait and typically sits at around $400\,\mathrm{m}$ deep; and finally, 
the Polar Deep Water, defined by the water masses that aren't
able to communicate freely with the global ocean due to being trapped by the Arctic basin walls.



\begin{figure}

		The residence time for the different water masses are also shown (\cite{bonisch1995deep}). Reproduced from \cite{wilson1998amap}.}
	\label{fig:amap}
\end{figure}

Because of the strong stratification, forcing from the ocean surface 
struggles to penetrate deep into the ocean; and so whether forced directly by wind 
or by sea ice stress, the circulation
directly forced from the surface is contained within the Polar Mixed Layer 
and halocline in the upper $200\,\mathrm{m}$ of the Arctic Ocean. 
This surface circulation has been well documented by observations
from cruises and moorings  dropped  from  the  ice  shelf  or  deployed  on 
the  shallower  continental  shelves (\cite{gerdes1997large}, \cite{jones2001circulation}). On the other hand, it is a very different
story for the circulation in the \gls{awl} and lower layers. Observations made
inside the Ocean's basins rarely are able to profile the structure  and
circulation  below 500m  although much progress has been made here in the
past decade. This lack of observations means that  we  still only have  a  sense  of  the circulation 
of the \gls{awl} and the Deep  Waters.  The  observations  we  do 
have  infer stable cyclonic  rim  currents about each of the basins in the
\gls{awl} and it is believed that this trend extends through the Deep Water to the 
ocean floor (\figref{fig:Proshutinsky2005Circulation}).  It is apparent that the surface flows have little correlation with these deep circulations, this is because of the 
strong stratification in the halocline, and hence only leaves a handful of other possibilities for determining the processes that set the deep water circulation.

	\label{fig:Proshutinsky2005Circulation}
\end{figure}

There has been much discussion
of how the fluxes in and out of the Arctic could influence the circulation,
for example, by a forcing a balance of \gls{pv} within the region by
the fluxes of \gls{pv} though the boundaries. \cite{yang2005arctic} demonstrates 
in an idealised barotropic model of a basin how, by controlling the flux 
of \gls{pv} through inflows and outflows
at the boundary, the circulation in the basin can be switched between cyclonic and
anti-cyclonic circulations (\figref{fig:Yang2005}). This principle suggests
that the persistent cyclonic nature of the \gls{awl} is induced by a 
net influx of \gls{pv} via the Arctic Gateways. 

Fortunately, permanent moorings 
covering the majority of the ocean gateways into the Arctic~Ocean have built
up a detailed picture of the transport in and out of the Arctic Ocean 
(\cite{tsubouchi2012arctic}, \figref{fig:Tsubouchi2012Transport}). The net flux of \gls{pv} into the Arctic is then estimated by summing the distribution of \gls{pv}; given by $ \Pi_{i} = fQ_{i}/H_{i}$,
where $Q_{i}$ is the volume transport and $H_i$ the depth, for location $i$. 
Whilst there is a tendency for total to infer a positive influx of \gls{pv}, the
results are not convincing; \cite{munchow2006observational} shows that by including the
Canadian Archipelago in the \cite{yang2005arctic} calculation the flux can be negated whilst
\cite{tsubouchi2012arctic} demonstrates large variations of transport from the mean over time.
These factors, especially the large variability, make it unconvincing that its the \gls{pv}
 transport, or in fact any properties of the gateway fluxes, that determines the 
cyclonic nature of the \gls{awl}.
Hence, the deep water circulation in the Arctic Ocean is most likely determined by 
internal processes, which are poor understood, especially in an Ocean with such sparse observations.

A likely candidate for generating a cyclonic circulation in the Northern hemisphere is
geostrophic turbulence. A number of studies have demonstrated how, in an eddying system, 
sloping topography can generate along-topography flows (\cite{treguier1989topographically}, \cite{adcock2000interactions}, \cite{nost2008asymmetry}). Hence, in the absence of stronger
forcing, this effect is likely to become the dominant feature. An obvious question that then
comes to mind is how turbulent is the Arctic Ocean? Over recent years a large amount  of 
effort has been made to observe and catalogue eddies in the Arctic
(\cite{zhao2014characterizing}) and has demonstrated their prevalence in the Arctic Ocean.
Whilst these studies have frequently been focused on the halocline and the surface dynamics
there is good reason to believe that eddies also penetrate deep into the Arctic 
(\figref{fig:Woodgate2001Mooring}, \cite{woodgate2001arctic}).

\section{Eddy-Mean Flow Interaction Theory}

\label{meaneddyinteractiontheory}

 Whilst observations play a vital role in understanding the Arctic
 Ocean and its role in the global ocean, progress is limited by the sparsely available
 observations that only usefully reach back a handful of decades into the past.
 To be able to test possible scenarios and make future predictions it is vital
 that we have reliable simulations of the Arctic Ocean (\cite{proshutinsky2008toward});
 however, due to limitations
 in modern computing power and poor understanding of the unresolved processes 
 in the ocean this is, more often than not, far from reality.
 Due to these computational limits a practical \gls{gcm} is 
 limited to a  resolution of the order of tens of kilometres. This means that with a 
 resolution  cut off at around $10 \textendash 100 \, \mathrm{km}$, 
 \glspl{gcm} are unable to fully resolve a large portion of the mesoscale turbulence that is
 observed in the physical ocean.
 By attempting  to understand the physics behind these unresolved processes 
 and developing parameterisations that mimic their effect on the resolved ocean
 the value of computational models can be improved without dramatically increasing the
 computing power required.  
 
 The turbulent, chaotic nature of the ocean is caused by the non-linearity of its 
 governing equations. Because of this,  the discretisation of the equations generates cross-correlation, or eddy, terms when applying the 
 averaging operator,
 \begin{equation}
 \mean{\phi\psi} = \mean{\phi}\,\mean{\psi} + 
 \mean{\res{\psi}\res{\psi}},
 \label{non-lin average}
 \end{equation}
 where the ${\mean{\phi}}$ is the average of the variable ${\phi}$, used in
 the discretisation and satisfying
 the expected properties of an averaging operator, and the prime denotes the residual, ${\phi^{\prime} = \phi - \mean{\phi}}$.
 The discretised system has no knowledge of the residual terms and hence
 the contributions to the full system by these eddy terms are
 ignored in the discretised system. It is, therefore, this ``sub-grid scale process"
 that is missing from the model dynamics and so it is common practise to try and
 `close' the system by including a parameterisation of the eddy
 term in place of the term itself, which is usually dependent on the averaged 
 variables and some physical assumptions.
 
 \subsection{\cite{gent1990}}
 
 The earliest ocean models (\cite{bryan1969numerical}) had vertical $z$-coordinate, or depth-coordinates, with simple horizontal and vertical Laplacian diffusion to act as 
 the closure. Whether these terms are interpreted as a parameterisation for the effects
 of unresolved turbulence or simply as a numerical tool to avoid noise at 
 the grid scale, the viscosity parameter is tuned such that the turbulent energy cascade is 
 dissipated at the grid scale whilst still allowing as active dynamics as possible. 
 Assuming modern day computing power, this implies a horizontal viscosity of around 
 $10^{5} - 10^{7} \mathrm{Pa} \cdot \mathrm{s}$, a viscosity more typical of peanut butter than 
 the ocean. A second problem with having such a strong horizontal diffusion is
 that it diffuses or mixes tracers horizontally, when applied as
 an eddy parameterisation for tracer mixing. 
 
 It has long been understood that tracers 
 mix much more along isopycnal surfaces than across them (\cite{iselin1939influence}, \cite{montgomery1940present}),  a property which helps maintain the definition of
 distinct water masses in the global ocean (for example, \cite{emery1986global}).
  In contrast, excessive horizontal diffusion
 of tracers in ocean models leads to water mass properties
 being eroded and spurious sources and sinks of heat in the 
 ocean interior, or the ``Veronis Effect" (\cite{veronis1975role}).
 Hence, a more physically appropriate eddy parameterisation 
 is needed;
  and so, in a way that seems obvious today, eddies need to be
   parameterised in 
 such a way that their effect is isopycnal. 
 The effort to do this in the 80's and early 90's gave birth
 to what is known as the \gls{gm}, first introduced in \cite{gent1990}.
 
 So what is the \gls{gm} parameterisation? Since mixing occurs primarily
 along isopycnal surfaces it make sense to have this discussion in
 isopycnal coordinates, that is in the coordinate space $(x,y,\rho)$,
  where density, $\rho$, has replaced depth, $z$, as the vertical
  coordinate. Whilst the rigorous exploration of this coordinate system
  will be discussed in detail later on, in the \secref{youngtwa}, for our current purposes 
  it is enough to say that this coordinate system produces an equation
  for isopycnal ``thickness",
  \begin{equation}
  \label{cont}
  \frac{\partial z_{\rho}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(z_{\rho}\boldsymbol{u}\right) = 0,
  \end{equation}
  where $z_{\rho} = {\partial z}/{\partial \rho}$ is defined as the
   isopycnal thickness and $\boldsymbol{u}$ is the horizontal fluid
   velocity. Since it is non-linear, when this equation is discretised
   it produces an eddy covariance term as demonstrated by 
   \equref{non-lin average}; the averaged equation can be written as
     \begin{equation}
     \frac{\partial \mean{z_{\rho}}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{z_{\rho}} \, \mean{\boldsymbol{u}}\right) = - \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{\res{z_{\rho}} \res{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right).
     \label{meancont}
     \end{equation}
   The eddies should therefore be parameterised by some representation
   of $\mean{\res{z_{\rho}} \res{\boldsymbol{u}}}$, say $\boldsymbol{F}$,
   so that the thickness equation becomes
     \begin{equation}
     \frac{\partial z_{\rho}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(z_{\rho}\boldsymbol{u}\right) + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{F} = 0,
     \label{thicknessgeneralparam}
     \end{equation}
    where the bars have been dropped for convenience. It can also 
    be noted that by defining $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}} = \boldsymbol{F}/z_{\rho}$ the above equation can be interpreted as
    the isopycnal thickness
    being advected by the mean horizontal velocity, $\boldsymbol{u}$, 
    plus an eddy induced
    `bolus velocity', $\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}$ (\cite{gent1995parameterizing}). \cite{gent1990} proposes that eddies act to flatten each
    isopyncal via baroclinic instability, achieved by
    setting 
    \begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{F} = - \left(\kappa
        \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)_{\rho},
    \end{equation}
    where $\kappa$ can be a
     spatially and temporally varying ``eddy diffusivity". Combining this with  \equref{thicknessgeneralparam} we have
          \begin{equation}
          \frac{\partial z_{\rho}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(z_{\rho}\boldsymbol{u}\right) = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\kappa
              \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)_{\rho} .
              \label{contgm}
          \end{equation}
    By \cite{gent1995parameterizing}, we can similarly, for a tracer, say $\tau$, write an equation
    describing its transport,
            \begin{equation}
              \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial t} +
               %\left(\boldsymbol{u}+\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}\right)
                \boldsymbol{u}
              \cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}\tau = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\tau\cdot
              \left(\kappa \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)_{\rho}/z_{\rho} .
            \end{equation}
            
    There are a few properties of this parameterisation that can be 
    noted to help describe the effect of its implementation in
    ocean models. Firstly, by writing $\boldsymbol{u}^{\star} = \boldsymbol{u} -
    \left(\kappa \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)_{\rho}/z_{\rho}$ we 
    simply have that 
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial z_{\rho}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(z_{\rho}\boldsymbol{u}^{\star}\right) = 0
    \end{equation}
     and
     \begin{equation}
     \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}^{\star}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}\tau = 0
     \end{equation} 
      indicating
    that the tracer $\tau$ is effectively advected by a transport velocity, 
     $\boldsymbol{u}^{\star}$. Secondly, an important 
    question is, how does \gls{gm} change the energy of the system? 
    By dotting the momentum equations with $\boldsymbol{u}$ and
    multiplying \equref{contgm} by the Montgomery potential, $\phi$,
    we gain the term
    \begin{equation}
    \phi \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\kappa
                      \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)_{\rho} 
                      = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\phi\kappa
                           \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)_{\rho} 
                      -\left(\kappa
                  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\phi\cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)_{\rho} 
                                    -\left(\kappa g
                                \boldsymbol{\nabla}z\cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} z \right)/{\rho_{0}} 
    \end{equation} 
     to the right hand side of the energy tendency. Integrating over an entire domain
                eliminates the first two terms leaving the final term
                as a positive definite sink of energy. These two 
                properties characterise \gls{gm}; the parameterisation
                acts along isopycnal surfaces to flatten isopycnal 
                surfaces whilst dissipating potential energy.
                
        The dissipative nature of \gls{gm} is both an strength and a
         weakness. \gls{gm} is incapable of introducing spurious energy,
         which allows it to be very robust and stable
         parameterisation, meaning it can be easily implemented 
         into a \gls{gcm}. However, it is also understood that
         ocean turbulence is not purely dissipative.
          \cite{adcock2000interactions} concisely demonstrate that
         in an idealised model, with no external forcing other
         than an initial eddy field, a persistent mean flow will develop along
         topography and the isopycnals will dome above the topography.
          \cite{nost2008asymmetry} show that these
         flows develop asymmetrically, such that the flow is 
         predominantly cyclonic above the sloped sides of
         a basin or anticyclonic over a sea-mount. For this to occur 
         when the eddy field is unresolved there must be an 
         injection of energy into the system representing the 
         inverse cascade of energy from the eddy scales to the large scale.
         However, this is prohibited by the purely dissipative \gls{gm}
         and so a different parameterisation is required to mimic this
         effect.
         
         
         
         \subsection{\gls{pv} Closure}
         
         To proceed one might wonder what makes the continuity equation
         so special? In truth there are a number of non-linearities that
         crop up when examining the full equations of motion. Take, for example, the
         absolute vorticity equation, which can be written in the same flux form as the continuity equation, i.e.
           \begin{equation}
           \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\omega\boldsymbol{u}\right) = 0,
           \label{vort}
           \end{equation}
           where $\omega=f+\xi$ is the absolute vorticity and
           $\xi = \boldsymbol{k} \cdot\left( \boldsymbol{\nabla}\wedge \boldsymbol{u}\right)$ is the relative vorticity
           in the absence of forcing or stretching. 
           By applying an average operator to \equref{vort}, we have the same averaged equation as \equref{meancont} but for the mean absolute vorticity, $\mean{\omega}$,
                \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial \mean{\omega}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{\omega} \, \mean{\boldsymbol{u}}\right) = - \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{\res{\omega} \res{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right),
                \end{equation}
                which to close in a numerical model requires the
                right hand side, $- \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{\res{\omega} \res{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right)$, to be parameterised.
                \cite{greatbatch1998exploring} makes the observation
                here that the mechanism this equation is describing 
                is much clearer if we note the following; if we take
                $\mean{q}$ to be the thickness weighted mean of $q$, i.e.
                $\mean{q}=\mean{z_{\rho}q}/\mean{z}_{\rho}$, then 
                $\mean{\omega}=\mean{q}\,\mean{z}_{\rho}$ and $\res{\omega}=\mean{z}_{\rho}\res{q}+\mean{q}\res{z}_{\rho}$. By 
                combining this with \equref{meancont} we gain a conservative equation 
                for \gls{pv}, 
                \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial \left(\mean{z}_{\rho} \mean{q}\right)}{\partial t} +
                 \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{z}_{\rho}\,\mean{q}\,\mean{\boldsymbol{u}}+\mean{q}\mean{\res{z}_{\rho} \res{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right)
                 = - \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{z}_{\rho}\,\mean{\res{q} \res{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right) .
                 \label{meanpveq}
                \end{equation}
                This being the form of \gls{pv}, which leads to the impermeability theorems
                of \cite{haynes1987evolution} and \cite{haynes1990conservation}.
                
                Now, by making the same assumption that was made for isopycnal thickness in 
                \gls{gm} for \gls{pv}, that ocean eddies mix PV along isopycnals in the down-gradient direction, \equref{meanpveq} becomes
                \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial \left(\mean{z}_{\rho} \mean{q}\right)}{\partial t} +
                \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mean{z}_{\rho}\,\mean{q}\,\mean{\boldsymbol{u}}+\mean{q}\mean{\res{z}_{\rho} \res{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right)
                = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\kappa \mean{z}_{\rho}\,\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mean{q}\right) ,
                \label{parammeanpveq}
                \end{equation}
                where the small slope approximation has been used, as demonstrated in
                \cite{gent1990}. By using Equations~\ref{meancont}~and~\ref{parammeanpveq} we have exactly the equation for an arbitrary tracer given in Equation 6 of \cite{gent1995parameterizing},
                \begin{equation}
                \frac{D^\star \mean{q}}{D t}\equiv\frac{\partial \mean{q}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{u}^\star\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mean{q} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot
                \left(\kappa \mean{z}_{\rho}\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mean{q} \right)/\mean{z}_{\rho} ,
                \label{pvclosure}
                \end{equation}
                applied to the mean \gls{pv}, which is advected by the transport velocity $\boldsymbol{u}^\star$ and diffused along isopycnal surfaces. This is now
                the \gls{pv} closure as was first proposed by \cite{greatbatch1998exploring}.
                
                \equref{pvclosure} represents the interaction of eddies as the
                down-gradient diffusion of \gls{pv}; and hence suggests that eddies
                act to homogenise \gls{pv}. Since \gls{pv} can be approximately written
                as $q=f/\sigma$ for small relative vorticity, the parametrisation acts  to homogenise isopycnal thickness. In the case 
                where there is no topography this is identical to the flattening of isopycnals.
                However, in the presence of topography homogenised isopycnal thickness
                causes the isopycnals to mimic the shape of the topography and hence 
                rise over topography. Unfortunately, to allow this to happen freely
                clearly violates energy conservation, as demonstrated schematically in 
                \figref{fig:Colddoming}. In reality, the ocean attempts to 
                homogenise \gls{pv} but only so far as it can with the available energy;
                the result is the slight ``cold doming" above topography as observed in
                \cite{adcock2000interactions}. 
                
                However, whilst, unlike \gls{gm}, the downgradient
                dissipation of \gls{pv} is capable of introducing spurious energy, it does
                dissipate another important quantity: 
                the ``Potential Enstrophy". By multiplying through 
                by $\mean{z}_{\rho} \mean{q}$, \equref{pvclosure} becomes 
                \begin{equation}
                \frac{\partial  }{\partial t}\left(\half z_{\rho}q^{2}\right) + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(z_{\rho}q\boldsymbol{u}^\star-\kappa z_{\rho}q\boldsymbol{\nabla} q
                \right)=-\kappa z_\rho \boldsymbol{\nabla}q\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}q
                \end{equation}
                where the bars have been dropped for convenience.
                Integrating over the entire domain eliminates the divergent term
                leaving just a positive definite dissipation.
                Hence, in the same way that \gls{gm} dissipates potential energy, this
                \gls{pv} closure dissipates potential enstrophy. This suggests the tantalising
                possibility that eddy-mean interactions are \gls{gm}-like when
                there is limited eddy energy available but diffuse \gls{pv} when
                limited by eddy enstrophy.

                \subsection{Eliassen-Palm Flux Tensor}
                
                It is clear from these attempts to parameterise the eddy-mean interaction
                that the only way to proceed is by being able to take into account 
                all eddy correlations that appear in the state equations. Residual-mean theory
                allows the directionally averaged primitive equations to be written such that 
                only diabatic buoyancy
                fluxes only appear in the thermodynamic equation whilst the eddy-mean
                interactions in the momentum equations appear as the divergence of Eliassen-Palm 
                Flux vectors (\cite{eliassen1961transfer}, \cite{andrews1976planetary}). 
                
                
                The Eliassen-Palm flux vectors also appear in other descriptions of ocean dynamics.
                In the averaged hydrostatic primitive equations, the eddy-mean interactions
                appear as two Eliassen-Palm flux vectors, one for each component of the horizontal velocity
                (\cite{young2012exact}). Similarly, a rank-two Eliassen-Palm flux tensor
                can be derived for the statistically steady quasi-geostrophic equations (\cite{cronin1996eddy}). \cite{maddison2013eliassen} demonstrate
                the geometric relationship between Eliassen-Palm fluxes and how they
                collapse into a single coordinate invariant tensor in the
                quasi-geostrophic limit up to a gauge transformation.
                In this limit the Eliassen-Palm flux tensor can be written as
                \begin{equation}
                \boldsymbol{E} 
                =\left(  \begin{array}{ccc}
                -M+P &
                N & 0 \\
                N &  
                M + P & 0\\
                -S  &  
                R & 0\\
                \end{array} \right) 
                \end{equation}
                (\cite{plumb1986three}), where 
                \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{ccc}
                M = \frac{\mean{{\res{v}}^{2} - {\res{u}}^{2}}}{2}, & 
                N = \mean{\res{u}\res{v} }, &
                P =  \frac{\mean{{\res{b}}^{2}}}{2\mathcal{N}_{0}^{2}},  \\ 
                R =  \frac{f_{0}}{\mathcal{N}_{0}^{2}}\mean{\res{b}\res{u}}, \, & \rm and  &  
                S = \frac{f_{0}}{\mathcal{N}_{0}^{2}}\mean{\res{b}\res{v}} ;
                \end{array} 
                \end{equation}
                 and where $f_{0}$ is the mean value of the Coriolis parameter and $\mathcal{N}_{0}$ is the buoyancy frequency. \cite{marshall2012framework}
                demonstrates that by taking a weighted Frobenius norm on $\boldsymbol{E} $
                and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality a handful of times the 
                 tensor is bounded by the eddy energy
                 \begin{equation}
                 {\left\|\boldsymbol{E}\right\|\leq\sqrt{2}\left(K+P\right)\equiv \sqrt{2}E},
                 \end{equation} 
                 where $K={\mean{{\res{u}}^{2} + {\res{v}}^{2}}}/{2}$ is the eddy
                 kinetic energy.
                 Without any loss of generality, this bound allows us to rewrite the components of the tensor in the form
                 \begin{equation}
                 \begin{array}{cc}
                 M = -\gamma_{m}E\cos{2\phi_{m}}\cos^{2}{\lambda}, & 
                 N = \gamma_{m}E\sin{2\phi_{m}}\cos^{2}{\lambda}, \\
                 P =  E\sin^{2}{\lambda}, &  K =  E\cos^{2}{\lambda},  \\
                 R =  \gamma_{b}\frac{f_{0}}{\mathcal{N}_{0}^{2}}E\cos{\phi_{b}}\sin{2\lambda}, &
                 S = \gamma_{b}\frac{f_{0}}{\mathcal{N}_{0}^{2}}E\sin{\phi_{b}}\sin{2\lambda} .
                 \end{array} 
                 \end{equation}
                 Here we have introduced two eddy anisotropies, $0\leq\gamma_{m},\gamma_{b}\leq1$, two eddy flux angles $0\leq\phi_{m},\phi_{b}\leq\pi$ and an eddy energy partition angle,
                 $0\leq\lambda\leq\pi/2$. Now the Eliassen-Palm flux tensor
                 is written in terms of five non-dimensional, bounded parameters
                 and $E$, the eddy energy. See \cite{marshall2012framework} for further details.
                 
                 
                 
                 \subsection{Thickness Weighted Averaging}
                 \label{youngtwa}
                 
                Returning to the Arctic Ocean as discussed in \secref{arcticocean},
                the ocean is a relatively quiescent and highly stratified ocean. 
                With that in mind, an appropriate framework for describing
                the dynamics of the Arctic is the hydrostatic primitive equations
                in isopycnal coordinates. \cite{young2012exact} carefully constructs
                these equations from Cartesian coordinate hydrostatic primitive equations,
                \begin{subequations}
                	\begin{equation}
                	\frac{D u}{D t} -fv + p_{x} = \mathcal{X} \\
                	\end{equation}
                	\begin{equation}
                	\frac{D v}{D t} +fu + p_{y} = \mathcal{Y} \\
                	\end{equation}
                	\begin{equation}
                	p_{z} = b \\
                	\end{equation}
                	\begin{equation}
                	u_{x} + v_{y} + w_{z} = 0 \\
                	\end{equation}
                	\begin{equation}
                	\frac{D b}{D t} = \omega,
                	\end{equation}
                \end{subequations}
                where $b(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ is the buoyancy,
                 $\rho=\rho_{0}\left(1-g^{-1}b\right)$; $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$
                 denote adiabatic processes and body forces and $\omega$ represents
                 any diabatic forcing. 
                 
                 In isopycnal coordinates this becomes
                 \begin{subequations}
                 	\label{isopyceq}
                 	\begin{equation}
                 	\frac{D u}{D t} -fv + m_{x} = \mathcal{X} \\
                 	\end{equation}
                 	\begin{equation}
                 	\frac{D v}{D t} +fu + m_{y} = \mathcal{Y} \\
                 	\end{equation}
                 	\begin{equation}
                 	m_{b} + \eta = 0  \\
                 	\end{equation}
                 	\begin{equation} 
                 	\label{isopyccont}
                 	\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial t}  + \left( \sigma u\right)_{x} + \left( \sigma v\right)_{y} + \left( \sigma \omega\right)_{b} = 0 .
                 	\end{equation}
                 \end{subequations}
                 Here $z \equiv \eta(x,y,b,t) $, where the symbol $\eta$ is used to distinguish 
                 it as a dependent function; ``$\frac{D}{Dt} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
                 + u\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
                 + \omega\frac{\partial}{\partial b}$" is the
                  convective derivative in isopycnal coordinates; $m \equiv p-b\eta$ is the 
                  Montgomery potential and $\sigma \equiv \eta_{b} = -m_{bb}$.
                  Compare the continuity equation, \equref{isopyccont}, with 
                  \equref{cont}, noting that
                  $\sigma = \eta_{b}$ is equivalent to $-z_{\rho}$. Using Equations~\eqref{isopyceq}, an energy equation can also be derived,
                  \begin{equation}
                  \frac{\partial \sigma K}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = -\boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(\sigma K \boldsymbol{u} +
                  \sigma m \boldsymbol{u}\right) -\left(\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} m\right)_{b}, \\
                  \label{isopycenergyeq}
                  \end{equation}
                  where $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and $\omega$ 
                  have been taken to be zero for convenience and where $K=\half \left| \boldsymbol{u}\right|^{2}$ is kinetic energy and
                  $P=\eta^{2}$ is potential energy. Integrating over the entire domain,
                  the right hand side vanishes. 
                  
                  
                  Now, by defining a thickness weighted average,
                  $\thkmean{\psi}=\nthkmean{\sigma\psi}/\nthkmean{\sigma}$, where
                  $\nthkmean{\psi}$ is the standard average and their residuals,
                  $\thkres{\psi}=\psi-\thkmean{\psi}$ and $\nthkres{\psi}=\psi-\nthkmean{\psi}$,
                  \cite{young2012exact} constructs the Eliassen-Palm flux vectors, 
                  $\boldsymbol{E}^{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{E}^{v}$,  for
                  these equations so that the momentum equations become
                  \begin{subequations}
                  	\label{thkweigheq}
                  	\begin{equation}
                  	\frac{\spec{D} \thkmean{u}}{D t} -f\thkmean{v} + \nthkmean{m}_{x} 
                  	+\nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^u= \thkmean{\mathcal{X}} \\
                  	\end{equation}
                  	\begin{equation}
                  	\frac{\spec{D} \thkmean{v}}{D t} +f\thkmean{u} + \nthkmean{m}_{y}
                  	+\nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^v = \thkmean{\mathcal{Y}}, \\
                  	\end{equation}
                  	where ``$\frac{\spec{D} }{D t} = \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial t}
                  	+ \thkmean{u}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \thkmean{v}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
                  	+ \thkmean{\omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial b}$" is the
                  	mean convective derivative, whilst the continuity equation is just
                  	\begin{equation} 
                  	\frac{\partial \nthkmean{\sigma}}{\partial t}  + \left( \nthkmean{\sigma} \thkmean{u}\right)_{x} + \left( \nthkmean{\sigma} \thkmean{v}\right)_{y} + \left( \nthkmean{\sigma} \thkmean{\omega}\right)_{b} = 0 .
                  	\end{equation}
                   Here, $\boldsymbol{E}^{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{E}^{v}$ are defined as
                   \begin{equation}

                   \end{equation}
                \end{subequations}
                   Crucially, in \cite{young2012exact} the first two components of  $\boldsymbol{E}^{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{E}^{v}$ are directed along 
                   the isopycnals, whilst only  the third component directed through 
                   isopycnal surfaces; hence, in the adiabatic case (i.e. when $\omega=0$)
                   $ \nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{x}}$ and 
                   $\nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{y}}$ are
                   precisely the ``inviscid pressure drag"  or ``form drag" identified
                   by \cite{rhines1979theoretical} and represents the transfer of momentum
                   across isopycnal surfaces. One key feature of this formulation
                   is that the eddy stresses are all entirely described in the momentum
                   equations; hence one might wonder what has happened to 
                   the bolus velocity described by \cite{gent1995parameterizing}? 
                   It turns out that the thickness weighted velocity is precisely 
                   the transport velocity, since $\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}=\nthkmean{\sigma\boldsymbol{u}}/\nthkmean{\sigma}=\nthkmean{\boldsymbol{u}} + \nthkmean{\nthkres{\sigma}\nthkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}/\nthkmean{\sigma}$
                   and  $\nthkmean{\nthkres{\sigma}\nthkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}/\nthkmean{\sigma}$
                   is the bolus velocity. Hence, this implies that  the equations explicitly
                    represent the mean velocities as the  transport velocities.
                     To retrieve the bounds derived by \cite{marshall2012framework},
                     we write $\boldsymbol{E} = (\boldsymbol{E}^{u}, \boldsymbol{E}^{v}, 0)$
                     and note that in the geostrophic limit $m_x \sim fv$ and  $m_y \sim -fu$.
                     Then by writing 
                     \begin{equation}
                     \begin{array}{ccc}
                     M = \frac{\thkmean{{\thkres{v}}^{2} - {\thkres{u}}^{2}}}{2}, & 
                     N = \thkmean{\thkres{u}\thkres{v} }, \\
                     K = \frac{\thkmean{{\thkres{u}}^{2} + {\thkres{v}}^{2}}}{2}, & 
                     P =  {\nthkmean{{\nthkres{\eta}}^{2}}}/{\nthkmean{\sigma}},  \\ 
                     R =  f{\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{u}}}/{\nthkmean{\sigma}}, \, & \rm and  &  
                     S = f{\nthkmean{\nthkres{b}\nthkres{v}}}/{\nthkmean{\sigma}} ;
                     \end{array} 
                     \end{equation}
                     we have (in the adiabatic case) that
                     \begin{equation}
                     \boldsymbol{E}=\nthkmean{\sigma}\left(
                     \begin{array}{ccc}
                     -M+K+P & N & 0 \\
                     N & M+K+P & 0 \\
                     S & -R & 0 \\
                     \end{array}\right).
                     \end{equation}
                     By applying the Frobenius norm in a similar fashion to 
                     \cite{marshall2012framework} we recover the energy bound on
                      $\boldsymbol{E}$
                      
                      Equations~\equref{thkweigheq} are of the same form as Equations~\ref{isopyceq}.
                      Hence, it is possible to derive an
                      Rossby-Ertel \gls{pv} for the thickness weighted system
                      as
                      \begin{equation}
                      \frac{\spec{D} \spec{q}}{D t} + \nthkmean{m}_{x} 
                      +\nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\spec{\boldsymbol{F}}
                      +\nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\spec{\boldsymbol{\Gamma}}=0,
                      \end{equation} 
                      where
                      \begin{equation}
                      \spec{q}\equiv\frac{f+\thkmean{v}_{x}-\thkmean{u}_{y}}{\nthkmean{\sigma}},
                      \end{equation}
                      is the Rossby-Ertel \gls{pv}, $\Gamma$ contains only the diabatic terms involving $\thkmean{\mathcal{X}} $, $\thkmean{\mathcal{Y}} $ and $\thkmean{\omega} $ and 
                      \begin{equation}
                      \spec{\boldsymbol{F}}=\nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\left(
                      \begin{array}{c}
                      \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^v \\
                      -\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^u\\
                      0 \\
                      \end{array}\right).
                      \end{equation}
                      Hence, the \gls{pv} fluxes can be written in terms of
                      the momentum fluxes, whilst the momentum fluxes, ${\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^u = -\nthkmean{\sigma} \spec{\boldsymbol{F}}\cdot\boldsymbol{j}}$ and                      ${\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^v = \nthkmean{\sigma} \spec{\boldsymbol{F}}\cdot\boldsymbol{i}}$,
                      can be written in terms of the \gls{pv} fluxes.
                      Rather than $\spec{q}$, \cite{greatbatch1998exploring} suggest
                      the use of a thickness weighted Rossby-Ertel \gls{pv},
                      \begin{equation}
                      \thkmean{q}=\frac{\nthkmean{\sigma q}}{\nthkmean{\sigma}}=\frac{f+\nthkmean{v}_{x}-\nthkmean{u}_{y}}{\nthkmean{\sigma}},
                      \end{equation}
                      which leads  to
                      \begin{equation}
                      \frac{\spec{D} \left( \thkmean{q}\right)}{D t}
                      + \nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\nthkmean{\sigma}\thkmean{\thkres{q} \thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right)
                      +\nthkmean{\sigma}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}=0 ,
                      \end{equation}
                      where, again, $\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}$ only contains
                      diabatic terms. Compare with \equref{meanpveq}, and by noting that
                       ${\nthkmean{\sigma}\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}=\nthkmean{\sigma}\nthkmean{\boldsymbol{u}} + \nthkmean{\nthkres{\sigma}\nthkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}}$, we have the 
                       \cite{greatbatch1998exploring} form of \gls{pv} closure.
                       Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it is easily noted that
                       the norm of $\thkmean{\thkres{q} \thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}$ is bounded
                       \begin{equation}
                       \left\|\thkmean{\thkres{q} \thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right\|
                       \leq 2\sqrt{KQ},
                       \end{equation}
                       recalling that $K = \frac{\thkmean{{\thkres{u}}^{2} +
                       	{\thkres{v}}^{2}}}{2}$ is the eddy kinetic energy and $Q =
                        \frac{\thkmean{{\thkres{q}}^{2}}}{2}$ is the eddy potential enstrophy.
                       Providing $\spec{q} \sim \thkmean{q}$, which is equivalent 
                       to the  curl of the bolus velocities $\left(\nthkmean{\nthkres{\sigma}\nthkres{v}}/\nthkmean{\sigma}\right)_{x}-\left(\nthkmean{\nthkres{\sigma}\nthkres{u}}/\nthkmean{\sigma}\right)_{y}$ 
                       being small, then it can be assumed, in the adiabatic case,
                       that $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\spec{\boldsymbol{F}} \sim \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\thkmean{\thkres{q} \thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}\right)$ and so $\spec{\boldsymbol{F}}$,
                       and hence $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}$
                       is also bounded by  $2\sqrt{KQ}$.

\section{Numerical Models of Arctic}
\label{arcticnumerics}

	It was discussed in \secref{arcticocean} that to understand the circulation of the Arctic
	 Ocean it is necessary to use \glspl{gcm}. However, due to poorly resolved processes or
	  missing key physics, the \glspl{gcm} available show significant variability between
	   models and frequently display behaviour not depicted in observations. 
	A detailed comparison of the major Global Climate Models applied to the Arctic Ocean is
	 being carried out by the \gls{aomip} (see \cite{proshutinsky2008toward} and
	  \cite{proshutinsky2011recent}). In this section we will specifically discuss the skill
	   of these models in reflecting the Arctic circulation and specifically the difficulty
	    these models have in replicating the perceived flow in the Atlantic Water Layer.  

As mentioned in the previous section, the circulation in the freshwater layer is strongly
 governed by effects of surface forcing. To this extent, providing the various models being
  compared are given the same forcing, or equivalent depending on how the model is
   structured, then the resulting circulations are in good agreement
    (\cite{proshutinsky2005arctic}). They have been shown to have a good skill in simulating
     certain regimes which have been observed. However, despite good agreement of the general
      circulation inside the basin, there is still some variation between the climate models.
       The first is how the Pacific Water entering via Bering Strait is advected through the
    basin within the freshwater layer. The models, despite showing the same regime for the
     Freshwater layer demonstrate different distributions of the Pacific Water when
      represented as a passive tracer added in Bering Strait (\cite{proshutinsky2011recent}).
       However, it is difficult to
       determine the legitimacy of the models
       due to limited observations and without an easy way of determining which water originates from the Pacific. The
     most successful attempts at determining the distribution of Pacific Water have been
     done using tracers from other sources, such as radioactive tracers from the Atlantic and
      determining where they?re being blocked by Pacific water such as in \cite{karcher2004dispersion}. More crucially models struggle to coherently and accurately represent
    mechanisms for the release of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean. This is most likely
     due to poor representation of the Arctic Gateways specifically in the Canadian
      Archipelago, where many of the straits and channels are much narrower than can be
   comfortably resolved. However, whilst these discrepancies are important, they are
    not the main focus here due to the overall competence of climate models to
 represent the freshwater layer in the Arctic. The more distressing problem is
  their ability to represent the Atlantic Water Layer. 

Observations suggest that the Atlantic Water Layer circulates counter clockwise around the
 Arctic basins at a depth of $200$ to $800\mathrm{m}$
 (\figref{fig:Proshutinsky2005Circulation}). However, many attempts over the past twenty
 years to model the Atlantic Water Layer have resulted in confusing predictions where the
 circulation seemingly randomly organises into circulations that are cyclonic or
 anti-cyclonic with almost identical frequency. To attempt to diagnose the skill of a model
 to produce cyclonic boundary currents, \cite{holloway2007water} introduces the concept of ``topostrophy",
 defined as   $\tau=(\boldsymbol{f}\times\boldsymbol{V})\cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}D$, where
 $\boldsymbol{f}$  is the Coriolis force,  $\boldsymbol{V}$ is velocity and  $D$ is the total
 depth. This so called topostrophy is a measure the strength of along slope flows and gives
 positive values for currents that flow with the upslope to their right (e.g. for cyclonic
 rim currents) and negative values for the opposite.  When calculated for the major
 \gls{aomip} models, most show variable and ambiguous values for $\tau$  whereas models that
 employ the ``Neptune Effect" parameterisation, mentioned in \secref{entropy}, show a persistent and positive
 value for  $\tau$ (\cite{proshutinsky2011recent}). \cite{holloway2009representing} examine
 simultaneous simulations using the NEMO model run with and without the Neptune Effect and
 show that the addition of this particular parameterisation is the likely cause of this
 tendency (\figref{fig:HolloWang2009}).

The right panel clearly gives a better representation of the topographically aligned currents observed in the Arctic Ocean.  \cite{holloway2009representing}}
	\label{fig:HolloWang2009}
\end{figure}


The \gls{aomip} has demonstrated that \glspl{gcm} are woefully inadequate for predicting the
accurate circulation in the \gls{awl}. The evidence seems to suggest that this is because, on 
climate time-scales, a \gls{gcm} can at best be eddy-permitting and hence
lack the geostrophic turbulence that appears to be critical for setting the 
cyclonic circulation in the \gls{awl}. As discussed in \secref{meaneddyinteractiontheory},
the eddy parameterisations used in modern \glspl{gcm}, namely \gls{gm}, are too 
dissipative and fail to express the driving nature of eddy-topography interactions. 
The models that are more successful either better resolve the eddy fields or apply 
a corrective force, such as the ``Neptune Effect", in irresponsible manner. 


\section{Summary and Hypothesis}

Since the likes of \cite{young1982shear}, \cite{holloway1987systematic} and
\cite{gent1990}, we have seen much development of how to describe the mean-eddy interaction.
Attempting to parameterise this in non-eddy-resolving models has lead to 
continuity and \gls{pv} closure parameterisations such as \cite{gent1990}
and \cite{greatbatch1998exploring} as well maximum entropy principle parameterisations 
such as the ``Neptune Effect" (\cite{holloway1992representing}) and \cite{polyakov2001eddy}.
However, to date these parameterisations fail woefully over topography. Either
they are far to dissipative, like \gls{gm}, and fail to represent the driving nature
of eddies-topographic interactions, or they violate energy conservation
by failing to appropriately control the energy injected into the system, as in the cases
of \gls{pv} closure and the ``Neptune Effect". To avoid this, models attempting to
use non-dissipative parameterisations often attempt to tune the parameterisation in
an ad-hoc fashion to avoid spurious energy injection. However, by carefully implementing
the framework put forward by \cite{marshall2012framework} and generalised in
\cite{maddison2013eliassen}, one might create a parameterisation which is
inherently bounded by energy and enstrophy constraints.

The discussion in this Section has shown that the mean-eddy interactions 
emerge with competing \gls{gm}-like and ``Neptune Effect''-like natures
\cite{adcock2000interactions}. Meanwhile  it's possible to show that
the Eliassen-Palm flux tensor can be bounded by eddy energy and eddy enstrophy
\cite{marshall2012framework}.
Diagnosis of the contributions to the eddy stress tensor from
the eddy kinetic and potential energy, as well as the Reynolds stress angle and eddy bouyancy flux angle will allow the investigation of the following:
\begin{itemize} 
		\item How much topographic slope is the controlling factor for the structure of the eddy stresses in eddy-topographic interactions.
		\item How limited energy is likely to inhibit the ability for the eddies the
			generate a mean along-topography flow.
	    \item That $\spec{q} \sim \thkmean{q}$ so that the enstrophy bound hold for $\spec{F}$,
		\item and hence, whether eddy stresses are limited by the available eddy enstrophy in the system.
\end{itemize} 
 

\chapter{Developement of Stacked Shallow Water Equations}
\label{sweq}

With the hope of taking advantage of the invariance demonstrated by 
\cite{maddison2013eliassen}, we need to be able to diagnose the
eddy terms in a controlled and repeatable environment. Hence, we turn our attention to
idealised models as a representation of ocean dynamics. This has an advantage 
over using observational data as well as output from \glspl{gcm} for a number of reasons.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The main limitation is that for this analysis to work, it must be possible to define an
	averaging operator that splits the eddy components of the system from the mean
	components, the most effective way of achieving this is to have a large data sample
	whose average is the mean state. Due to the lack of observational data, especially in the
	Arctic Ocean,this  technique is not feasible.
	\item Similarly, defining what is meant by the ``mean component" is non-trivial in the physical ocean. Ideally, we would require a mean such that the residual term is precisely the 
	geostrophic turbulence that we are interested in. However, the ocean exhibits a multitude 
	oscillations and variability, such as seasonal and diurnal cycles, tides and many other
	non-linear effects from a combination of these and other processes, hence an average which
	is applied across this variability will include these effects in the residual components.
	\item This problem also applies to \glspl{gcm} which are often the culmination of 
	a number of generations of research and development with respect to ocean processes.
	This means that a \gls{gcm} often has numerous parameterisations and modules, which are
	designed to give a better representation of the ocean but make separating the useful components
	for this study non-trivial. 
	\item Finally, the complex nature of \glspl{gcm} mean that there is potentially a large saving
	of computational power than can be made by simplifying the problem into an idealised situation.
\end{itemize}

Starting from the full primitive equations, we need to carefully make assumptions and
simplifications to create a representation of the ocean which is simple enough for our
purposes but still a close enough approximation to the ocean that any results are ultimately
 useful. Hence, we now set out the criteria required for such a model.
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Firstly, the governing equations obviously must be non-linear or else there will be
 	no turbulence and nothing to diagnose.
 	\item The models must be able to cope with a realistic range of topographic slopes.
 	In the Arctic Ocean the sea floor drops by around $3000$ metres over $10$'s of kilometres
 	in places.
 	\item Baroclinic effects must be represented. It is well understood that a major effect
 	of eddies is the baroclinic instability process that \gls{gm} attempts to represent.
 	\item The model must be fast. The whole point of making these idealisation is to have model
 	 that can be run at high resolution quickly.
 	 \item As mentioned above, we must be able to define an averaging operator which 
 	 allows for the decomposition into a reasonable ``mean component" and ``eddy component".
 \end{itemize}
In this section we follow the development of such a model 


\section{Stacked Shallow Water Theory}
\label{swtheory}

For our study, the equations that will give us the most efficient model whilst capturing the
 processes we would like are the stacked shallow water equations. Whilst this is a common
  simplification it is worth investigating whether it is an appropriate simplification to make
   here. 
   In deriving the shallow water equations we make approximations which are frequently made in
   most GFD analyses. The first of these approximations to make that is made is that the ocean
   incompressible or specifically the Boussinesq approximation. This is reasonable
   given the small size of deviations in density from the mean state
   that occurs in the ocean (\cite{vallis2006atmospheric}).
   The second approximation that is made is that the fluid is hydrostatic. That is to say that the equation ``${\partial p}/{\partial z} + \rho g=0$" holds, where $p$ is pressure, $\rho$
   is density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration and $z$ is the vertical coordinate. Despite
   the fact that non-hydrostatic effects are likely to affect the vertical velocity, since
   there are only limited areas in the Arctic where dense water could overspill into less
   dense water, it is sensible to assume the hydrostatic approximation by scale arguments:
   the vertical components of velocity will be orders of magnitude smaller than the
   horizontal velocities. This give us the hydrostatic, Boussinesq  primitive equations:
   \begin{subequations}
   \begin{equation}
   \frac{Du}{Dt}-fv = -\frac{1}{\rho}   \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}+F_{u}-D_{u}, \\
   \end{equation}
   \begin{equation}
   \frac{Dv}{Dt}+fu = -\frac{1}{\rho}   \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}+F_{v}-D_{v}, \\

   \begin{equation}

   \end{equation}
   \begin{equation}
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} +\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}  = 0 ,
   \end{equation}
   \end{subequations}
   where $(u,v)$ are the horizontal velocities, $w$ the vertical velocity, $f$ is the Coriolis
    parameter, and $F_{u}$, $F_{v}$, $D_{u}$ and  $D_{v}$ are the $u$- and $v$-components of
    the Forcing and  Dissipation.

    	\caption[Shallow Water Density Profile]{  A more realistic  continuous
    		density profile (left) compared to the discontinuous, piecewise constant 
    		density profile of the stacked shallow water equations with 3 layers (right)}
    	\label{fig:swdensity}
    \end{figure}
    
    The next step is to approximate the vertical density profile as a stack of
    fluids of constant density, as in \figref{fig:swdensity}. 
    This is to allow the shallow
    water approximation to be made whilst allowing for baroclinic effects by 
    deriving the shallow water equations for each layer separately. Formally, 
    the density profile is split into $N$ sections with constant densities 
    $\rho_{1}$ through to $\rho_{N}$, where $n=1$ is the lowest layer and $n=N$
    is the uppermost layer. Integrating the hydrostatic equation
    downwards from the surface yields 
    \begin{equation}
    p(x,y,z)=\sum^{N}_{k=n+1}\left(g \rho_{k} h_{k} \right) + g \rho_{n}\left(\eta_{n+\half } - z \right)
    \end{equation}
    for $\eta_{n-\half }\leq z \leq \eta_{n+\half }$. Here $\eta_{n+\half }(x,y,t)$,
    $\eta_{n-\half }(x,y,t)$ are the depths of the interfaces above and below layer $n$
    respectively and $h_{n} = \eta_{n+\half } -\eta_{n-\half }$ is the vertical
     thickness  of layer $n$. Similarly, by integrating the continuity equation over a layer
     we have
     \begin{equation}
     \begin{split}
     0 &=\int^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }}\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} +\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \right){\rm d} z \\
     &=\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\int^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }} u{\rm d} z +
     \frac{\partial }{\partial y}\int^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }} v{\rm d} z
      -  \left[ u   \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \right]^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }} 
      -  \left[ v  \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right]^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }}  +
      \left[ w \right]^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }} \\
     &=\frac{\partial h_{n} }{\partial t} +\frac{\partial h_{n} u_{n}}{\partial x}+
     \frac{\partial h_{n} v_{n} }{\partial y}.      \\
     \end{split}
     \end{equation}
   Here we have used that 
   \begin{equation*}
   \begin{array}{ccc}
   w =  \frac{\partial z }{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} 
         + v \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} &\mathrm{at}& z = \eta_{n+\half } , \eta_{n-\half },
   \end{array}
   \end{equation*}
   and
   \begin{equation*}
   \begin{array}{ccc}
   u_{n} =\frac{1}{h_{n}}\int^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }} u{\rm d} z &\mathrm{and}& v_{n} =\frac{1}{h_{n}}\int^{\eta_{n+\half }}_{\eta_{n-\half }} v{\rm d} z.
   \end{array}
   \end{equation*} 
   By also defining 
   the Montgomery potential as
   \begin{equation*}
   m_{n}(x,y,t)=p+g \rho_{n} z=\sum^{N}_{k=n}\left(\rho_{N} g_{k+\half } \eta_{k+\half } \right) 
   \end{equation*}
    where 
         $g_{n+\half } = {\rho_{n} - \rho_{n+1}}/{\rho_{N}}$, we have the stacked shallow water
   equations as derived in \cite{vallis2006atmospheric} and \cite{cushman2011introduction}, 
   \begin{subequations}
   	\label{sweqs}
   \begin{equation}
   \label{swumomeq}
   \frac{Du_{n}}{Dt}-fv_{n} = -\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}+F_{u_{n}}-D_{u_{n}}, \\
   \end{equation}
   \begin{equation}
   \label{swvmomeq}
   \frac{Dv_{n}}{Dt}+fu_{n} = -\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial y}+F_{v_{n}}-D_{v_{n}}, \\
   \end{equation}
   \begin{equation}
   \label{swthkeq}
   0 =\frac{\partial h_{n} }{\partial t} +\frac{\partial h_{n} u_{n}}{\partial x}+
   \frac{\partial h_{n} v_{n} }{\partial y}.\\
   \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
 We have three equations and the unknowns, $h_{n}$, $u_{n}$ and $v_{n}$, for each layer $n$. 
 
   It is worth noticing, here, the similarity between these equations and the isopycnal
    primitive    equations set out by \cite{young2012exact}, and repeated in  \secref{meaneddyinteractiontheory}. However, one should be aware that
    the two sets of equations describe different realities; $h_{n}$, for example, is not
    equivalent to $\sigma = {\partial z}/{\partial \rho}$ since in the shallow water
    equations $\sigma$ is not well-defined due to  $\rho$ being
    piecewise constant. This distinction is critical when considering the interfaces between each
    layer. In the isopycnal primitive equations the velocities, the Montgomery potential, 
    the energetics are all continuous throughout the water column, whereas in shallow 
    water there is a discontinuous jump between the layers. This causes problems when
    considering the transfer of information between different layers. To demonstrate this
    let us derive conservation of energy. By dotting the momentum equations, \ref{swumomeq}
    and \ref{swvmomeq}, with $h_{n}\boldsymbol{u}_{n}$ we gain an equation for the kinetic 
    energy, $K_{n}=\half \left|\boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right|^{2}$,
    \begin{equation}
    \label{swkeeq}
    \frac{\partial h_{n} K_{n}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial h_{n} K_{n} u_{n}}{\partial x}+
    \frac{\partial h_{n} K_{n} v_{n} }{\partial y} = - h_{n} u_{n}\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x} - h_{n} v_{n}\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial y},
    \end{equation}
    or in non-conservative form, 
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{D  K_{n}}{D t}  = - u_{n}\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x} - v_{n}\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial y},
    \end{equation}
    where the forcing and dissipation terms have been ignored. Now, since the
    each layer has constant density, the total potential energy in a column
    of water is easily calculated as $\sum_{n=1}^{N} \rho_{n} g h_{n}\eta_{n}$ where
    $\eta_{n}=\half  \left(\eta_{n-\half }+\eta_{n+\half }\right)$ is
    the centre of mass of each layer in the water column. By using that $h_{n} = \eta_{n+\half }-\eta_{n-\half }$ and manipulating the summation
    indices, we can also write
    \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{n=1}^{N} \rho_{n} g h_{n}\eta_{n} =
        \sum_{n=1}^{N}\half  \rho_{n} g \left(\eta_{n+\half }^{2}-\eta_{n-\half }^{2}\right) =
        \sum_{n=1}^{N}\half  \rho_{N} g_{n+\half } \eta_{n+\half }^{2}-\rho_{1}g\eta_{\half }^{2},
    \end{equation*} 
    where we 
    note that $\eta_{\half }$ is the bottom topography and so it constant
    in time. The total energy in the
    water column must therefore be 
    \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{n=1}^{N} \rho_{n}\left(h_{n} K_{n}+ g h_{n}\eta_{n}\right).
    \end{equation*}
     Combining this with \equref{swkeeq} we
    can write down an equation for the evolution of this energy,
        \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \rho_{n}\left(h_{n} K_{n}+ g h_{n}\eta_{n}\right)& \\
        = -\sum_{n=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left(\rho_{n} h_{n} K_{n} \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right)& 
        -\sum_{n=1}^{N}  h_{n} \boldsymbol{u}_{n}  \boldsymbol{\nabla} m_{n}
        +\sum_{n=1}^{N}\half  \rho_{N} g_{n+\half } \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\eta_{n+\half }^{2} .
        \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        This can be manipulated to give a less opaque equation.
        Firstly by applying the product rule to $\sum_{n=1}^{N}  h_{n} \boldsymbol{u}_{n}  \boldsymbol{\nabla} m_{n}$ and using
        the continuity equation, \equref{swthkeq}, we obtain
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
            \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \rho_{n}\left(h_{n} K_{n}+ g h_{n}\eta_{n}\right) 
            = -\sum_{n=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{\nabla} &\left[h_{n}  \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+ m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right]  \\
            &-\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(h_{n}\right)   m_{n}
            +\sum_{n=1}^{N}\half  \rho_{N} g_{n+\half } \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\eta_{n+\half }^{2}.
            \end{split}
            \end{equation}
          Now, by using  $h_{n} = \eta_{n+\half }-\eta_{n-\half }$
          and $m_{n} = m_{n+1} +  \rho_{N}g_{n+\half } \eta_{n+\half }$
          we have 
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\sum_{n=1}^{N} \rho_{n}\left(h_{n} K_{n}+ g h_{n}\eta_{n}\right) &+\sum_{n=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[h_{n} \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right] \\
    =&-\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)    m_{n+1} +\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right) m_{n}\\
    =&- \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{N+\half }\right)    m_{N+1} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{\half }\right) m_{1}.
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    Integrating over the entire domain makes the right hand side equal to zero since
    $m_{n+1} = 0$ and $\eta_{\half }$ is the bottom topography and so is constant in
    time. No problems so far! One would then expect to be able to write down
    an equation for the energy of a water column in a single layer, i.e. for 
    $\rho_{n}\left(h_{n} K_{n}+ g h_{n}\eta_{n}\right)$, however this is not
    so simple because now the transfer of energy between layers which cancelled neatly
    in through the full water column need to be taken accounted for:
    \begin{equation}
    \label{swlayerenergycalc}
    \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho_{n}\left(h_{n} K_{n}+ g h_{n}\eta_{n}\right) 
    =& - \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left(\rho_{n} h_{n} K_{n} \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right) 
    - h_{n} \boldsymbol{u}_{n}  \boldsymbol{\nabla} m_{n}
    +\half  \rho_{n} g \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }^{2} -\eta_{n-\half }^{2}\right) \\
    =& - \boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[h_{n}  \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+ m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right] \\
    &- \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(h_{n}\right)   m_{n}
    +\half  \rho_{n} g \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }^{2} -\eta_{n-\half }^{2}\right) \\
    =& -\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[h_{n} \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right] \\
    &- \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)\left(   m_{n}- \rho_{n}g \eta_{n+\half }\right) 
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right)\left(   m_{n}- \rho_{n}g \eta_{n-\half }\right) \\
    =& -\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[h_{n} \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right] \\
    &- \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)\left(   m_{n+1} - \rho_{n+1}g \eta_{n+\half }\right) 
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right)\left(   m_{n}- \rho_{n}g \eta_{n-\half }\right).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    Since $m_{n+1} - \rho_{n+1}g \eta_{n+\half }=p\rvert_{z=\eta_{n+\half }}$ and
    $m_{n} - \rho_{n}g \eta_{n-\half }=p\rvert_{z=\eta_{n-\half }}$ then the last
    two terms represent the transfer of energy to the layer above and from the layer below
    respectively. But \equref{swlayerenergycalc}
    can be rearranged both as
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{n} h_{n} K_{n}+ 
    \half \rho_{N} g_{n+\half }\eta_{n+\half }^{2} \right) 
    = -\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[h_{n} \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right] 
    - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)   m_{n+1}
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right) m_{n}
    \label{swlayercorrectenergy}
    \end{equation}
    or
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{n}h_{n} K_{n}+ 
    \half \rho_{N} g_{n-\half }\eta_{n-\half }^{2} \right) 
    = -\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[h_{n} \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right] 
    - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)   m_{n}
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right) m_{n-1};
    \end{equation}
    or in fact, any combination of the two
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{n}h_{n} K_{n}+ 
    \half \lambda\rho_{N} g_{n+\half }\eta_{n+\half }^{2}  +
    \half \left(1-\lambda\right)\rho_{N} g_{n-\half }\eta_{n-\half }^{2} \right) 
    = -\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[h_{n} \left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}\right] \\
    \begin{split}
    &- \lambda\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)   m_{n+1}
    + \lambda\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right) m_{n} \\
    &- \left(1-\lambda\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)   m_{n}
    + \left(1-\lambda\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right) m_{n-1}, \\
    \end{split}
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    where $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$. The reason for this is that the Montgomery potential,
    $m_{n}$, is constant in the vertical in the layers and discontinuous across the interfaces between the layers. Compare with \equref{isopycenergyeq} where the 
    vertical transfer of energy is given by 
    $\left(\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} m \right)_{b}$ and recall that since density is
     constant within a layer, $\frac{\partial }{\partial b}$ is not well-defined, and so for
      these equations the idea of potential energy is degenerative. However,
      for the sake of making progress with this discussion we will take the
      appropriate definition of potential energy as the term which appears in \equref{swlayercorrectenergy}.
    
    
    \section{Eddy Stresses}
    
    \label{eddymeantheory}
    
    In a similar fashion to the thickness weighted average  formulation for the primitive equations
    derived by \cite{young2012exact} (see \secref{youngtwa}), we can derive 
    mean equations for \equref{sweqs} using a thickness weighted averaging operator. 
    First we define the operator to be
    $\thkmean{\psi}=\nthkmean{h_{n}\psi}/\nthkmean{h_{n}}$, for a variable
    $\psi$ living in layer $n$, where
    $\nthkmean{\psi}$ is a standard average operator, satisfying the standard
    axioms of an averaging operator (for a more precise definition see \cite{maddison2013eliassen}); and their residuals,
    $\thkres{\psi}=\psi-\thkmean{\psi}$ and $\nthkres{\psi}=\psi-\nthkmean{\psi}$.
    By multiplying Equations~\eqref{swumomeq}~and~\eqref{swvmomeq} by $h_{n}$
    and using \equref{swthkeq}, we have that
    \begin{subequations}
    	\begin{equation}
    	\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left(h_{n} u_{n}\right) +\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(h_{n}u_{n}u_{n}\right)
    	+\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(h_{n}u_{n}v_{n}\right) - fh_{n}v_{n} = -\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   h_{n}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}+h_{n}F_{u_{n}}-h_{n}D_{u_{n}}, \\
    	\end{equation}
    	\begin{equation}
    	\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left(h_{n}v_{n}\right) +\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(h_{n}u_{n}v_{n}\right)
    	+\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(h_{n}v_{n}v_{n}\right) +fh_{n}u_{n} = -\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   h_{n}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial y}+h_{n}F_{v_{n}}-h_{n}D_{v_{n}}, \\
    	\end{equation}
    	\begin{equation}
    	0 =\frac{\partial h_{n} }{\partial t} +\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(h_{n} u_{n}\right)+
    	\frac{\partial  }{\partial y}\left(h_{n} v_{n}\right).\\
    	\end{equation}
    \end{subequations}
    Applying the non-thickness weighted averaging operator to these equations then gives
    us
    \begin{subequations}
    	\label{swundecconsequ}
    	\begin{equation}
    	\begin{split}
    	\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{u_{n}}\right) +\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{u_{n}u_{n}}\right)
    	&+\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{u_{n}v_{n}}\right) - f\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{v_{n}} \\
    	=& -\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \nthkmean{h_{n}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}}+\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{F}_{u_{n}}-\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{D}_{u_{n}}, \\
    	    	\end{split}
    	\end{equation}
    	\begin{equation}
    	    	\begin{split}
    	\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{v_{n}}\right) +\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{u_{n}v_{n}}\right)
    	&+\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{v_{n}v_{n}}\right) +f\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{u_{n}} \\
    	=& -\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}   \nthkmean{h_{n}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial y}}+\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{F}_{v_{n}}-\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{D}_{v_{n}}, \\
    	    	    	\end{split}
    	\end{equation}
    	\begin{equation}
    	0 =\frac{\partial \nthkmean{h_{n}} }{\partial t} +\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{ u_{n}}\right)+
    	\frac{\partial  }{\partial y}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{ v_{n}}\right).\\
    	\end{equation}
    \end{subequations}
    Applying Reynolds decomposition it is clear that the advection terms will
    supply Reynolds stresses, however the Montgomery potential term is more complicated.
    Recall that $h_{n}=\eta_{n+\half}-\eta_{n-\half}$ and that, by the definition of $m_{n}$,
    we have that $m_{n}=m_{n+1}+\rho_{N}g_{n+\half}\eta_{n+\half}$; hence,
   \begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
    h_{n}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}
    &=\eta_{n+\half}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}
    -\eta_{n-\half}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}\\
    &=\eta_{n+\half}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(m_{n+1}+\rho_{N}g_{n+\half}\eta_{n+\half}\right)
    -\eta_{n-\half}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}\\
    &=\left(\eta_{n+\half}\frac{\partial m_{n+1}}{\partial x}
    -\eta_{n-\half}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}\right)
    +\half\rho_{N}g_{n+\half}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\eta_{n+\half}^{2}\right),\\
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    and the equivalent for the $y$-component. Comparing this with the second 
    terms in \equref{youngtwaeptensor} and it is easy to identify these terms as being
    the form stress between layer $n$ and the layers above and below plus the potential
    energy. This also means that there is the same degeneracy as we had when 
    deriving the energy equations in \secref{swtheory} meaning that 
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    h_{n}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}
    =&\lambda\left[\left(\eta_{n+\half}\frac{\partial m_{n+1}}{\partial x}
    -\eta_{n-\half}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}\right)
    +\half\rho_{N}g_{n+\half}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\eta_{n+\half}^{2}\right)\right]\\
    &+\left(1-\lambda\right)\left[\left(\eta_{n+\half}\frac{\partial m_{n}}{\partial x}
    -\eta_{n-\half}\frac{\partial m_{n-1}}{\partial x}\right)
    +\half\rho_{N}g_{n-\half}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\eta_{n-\half}^{2}\right)\right]\\
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    for $0\leq\lambda\leq1$. However, for the sake of simplicity, let us just consider
    the case $\lambda = 1$. By decomposing \equref{swundecconsequ} and dividing 
    through by $\nthkmean{h_{n}}$ we have that 
    \begin{subequations}
    	\label{swtwaeqs}
    	\begin{equation}
    	\label{swtwaumomeq}

    	\begin{equation}

    	where ``$\frac{\spec{D}\thkmean{v}_{n}}{Dt}=\frac{\partial }{\partial t}+\thkmean{u}_{n}\frac{\partial }{\partial x}+\thkmean{v}_{n}\frac{\partial }{\partial y}$" is the

    	= \left(\psi_{n+\half}-\psi_{n-\half}\right)$" where $\psi_{n+\half}$ and $\psi_{n-\half}$ are the values of $\psi$ on the interfaces above and below
    	layer $n$ respectively; and $\boldsymbol{E}^{u}$, $\boldsymbol{E}^{v}$ are the
    	eddy stresses
    	\begin{equation}

    	\boldsymbol{E}^{u}=\nthkmean{h_{n}}\left(

    	\thkmean{\thkres{u}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}} \\
    	0 \\
    	\end{array}\right)+\left(

    	\half\rho_{N}g_{n+\half} \nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}_{n+\half}\nthkres{\eta}_{n+\half}} \\
    	0 \\
    	\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{x}} \\
    	\end{array}\right), \\ \\
    	\boldsymbol{E}^{v}=\nthkmean{h_{n}}\left(
    	\begin{array}{c}
    	\thkmean{\thkres{u}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}} \\
    	\thkmean{\thkres{v}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}} \\

    	\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{y}} \\
    	\end{array}\right). \\
    	\end{array}
    	\end{equation}
    As before, this can be written as a tensor,
    \begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{E}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
    -M + K + P & N & 0 \\
    N & M + K + P& 0 \\
    R & S & 0 \\
    \end{array}\right),
    \end{equation}
    \end{subequations}
    where 
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    M=\frac{\nthkmean{h_{n}}}{2}
    \left(\thkmean{\thkres{v}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}}-\thkmean{\thkres{u}_{n}\thkres{u}_{n}}\right),& K=\frac{\nthkmean{h_{n}}}{2}
    \left(\thkmean{\thkres{u}_{n}\thkres{u}_{n}}+\thkmean{\thkres{v}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}}\right),& N=\nthkmean{h_{n}}
    \thkmean{\thkres{u}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}},\\ P=\half\rho_{N}g_{n+\half} \nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}_{n+\half}\nthkres{\eta}_{n+\half}}, &
    R=\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{x}} \, \mathrm{and} & 
    S=\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{y}} ;\\
    \end{array}
    \end{equation*} 
    once again this
    can be bounded by the eddy energy.
    
    With this we have a formulation for the 
    averaged system which is equivalent to the
    unaveraged system but with the addition of an
    eddy stress term in the momentum equation.
    This means that one can derive an equation for \gls{pv} using the averaged system
    in an identical way to the unaveraged 
    system. Hence we have that the \gls{pv} for
    the averaged system is given by 
    \begin{equation}
    \spec{q}_{n} =
    \frac{f+\partialdiff[\thkmean{v}_{n}]{x}-\partialdiff[\thkmean{u}_{n}]{y}}
    {\nthkmean{h_{n}}},
    \end{equation} 
    satisfying
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\spec{D}\spec{q}_{n}}{D t} 
    =   -\nthkmean{h_{n}}^{-1}
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}
    \cdot\boldsymbol{\spec{F}},
    \label{avpveq}
    \end{equation} 
    where $
    \boldsymbol{\spec{F}}
    =   \nthkmean{h_{n}}^{-1}\left( \,
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}
    \cdot(\nthkmean{h_{n}}
    \boldsymbol{E}^{v}) \, , \,
    - \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}
    \cdot(\nthkmean{h_{n}}
    \boldsymbol{E}^{u}) \, \right)^{T}  $ and $\boldsymbol{E}^{u}$,  $\boldsymbol{E}^{v}$ are the
    columns of  $\boldsymbol{E}$. Here the forcing and dissipation terms, $\thkmean{
    	\boldsymbol{F}}$ and $\thkmean{
    	\boldsymbol{D}}$, have been ignored, but
    would be inherited from the momentum
    equation in the natural way. It should be noted that whilst $\thkmean{\spec{q}_{n}} = \spec{q}_{n}$, $\spec{q}_{n} \neq \thkmean{q}_{n}$.  However,
    $\spec{q}_{n}$ is 
    more useful than the averaged \gls{pv}, $\thkmean{q}_{n}$, because the eddy flux $
    \boldsymbol{\spec{F}} $ is directly related to the Eliassen-Palm tensor, whilst  $\spec{q}_{n}$ involves
    the weighted mean velocities and so is precisely the \gls{pv} for the averaged system. 
    Despite this, it is worth discussing $\thkmean{q}_{n}$ for 
    comparison. By applying the thickness weighted averaging operator to the 
    definition of $q_{n}$ we get 
    \begin{equation}
    \thkmean{q}_{n} =
    \frac{f+\partialdiff[\nthkmean{v}_{n}]{x}-\partialdiff[\nthkmean{u}_{n}]{y}}
    {\nthkmean{h_{n}}}.
    \end{equation} 
    Then we can derive the dynamical equation for
    $ \thkmean{q}$,
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    0&=\nthkmean{ h_{n} \left(\partialdiff[q_{n}]{t} + \boldsymbol{u}_{n} \cdot\boldsymbol{\nabla}q_{n} \right) } =
    \nthkmean{  \partialdiff{t}\left(h_{n}q_{n}\right) +  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(h_{n}\boldsymbol{u}_{n}q_{n} \right)}  \\
    &= \partialdiff{t} \left(\nthkmean{ h_{n} } \thkmean{q}_{n}\right)
    +  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left( \nthkmean{ h_{n}}\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}_{n}q_{n}} \right) \\
    &= \partialdiff{t} \left(\nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{q}_{n}\right) +  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left( \nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \, \thkmean{q}_{n} \right) +  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left( \nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\thkres{q}_{n}} \right) \\
    &= \nthkmean{h_{n}} \left(\partialdiff[\thkmean{q}_{n}]{t}+  \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}\thkmean{q}_{n} \right) +  \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left( \nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\thkres{q}_{n}} \right)
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    as used by \cite{greatbatch1998exploring} and \cite{smith1999primitive}.
    
    Similarly we can take the unweighted average of the
    conservative energy equation, \equref{swlayercorrectenergy}, to give an energy
    budget for the mean state. For the mean of the
    energy equation we have
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{n} \nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{K_{n}}+ 
        \half \rho_{N} g_{n+\half }\nthkmean{\eta_{n+\half }^{2}} \right)
        &+\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[\nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}}\right] \\
        =- \nthkmean{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n+\half }\right)   m_{n+1}}
        &+ \nthkmean{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\eta_{n-\half }\right) m_{n}}.
      \end{split}
                    \label{swtwameaneqenergy}
    \end{equation}
    But because we also have an equation for the mean dynamics, we
    can also write down the equation for the mean energy as
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{n} \nthkmean{h_{n}} \half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}+ 
        \half \rho_{N} g_{n+\half }\nthkmean{\eta_{n+\half }}^{2} \right) &+\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[\nthkmean{h_{n}} \left(\rho_{n}\half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}+\nthkmean{m_{n}}\right) \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right] \\
        =-\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \cdot \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}\cdot \boldsymbol{E}\right)&- \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nthkmean{\eta_{n+\half }}\right)   \nthkmean{m_{n+1}}
        + \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nthkmean{\eta_{n-\half }}\right) \nthkmean{m_{n}},
              \end{split}
              \label{swtwaeqmeanenergy}
    \end{equation}
    where we note that this equation differs from \equref{swlayercorrectenergy} by simply the eddy stress
    term $\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \cdot \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}\cdot \boldsymbol{E}\right)$.
    We can therefore difference \equref{swtwaeqmeanenergy} from
    \equref{swtwameaneqenergy} to retrieve an equation
    for the eddy energy.
        \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{n} \nthkmean{h_{n}} \half\thkmean{ \left|\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}}+ 
            \half \rho_{N} g_{n+\half }\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta_{n+\half ^{2}}}} \right)
            &\\
            +\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[\nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\left(\rho_{n}K_{n}+m_{n}\right) \boldsymbol{u}_{n}}\right] &-\boldsymbol{\nabla} \left[\nthkmean{h_{n}} \left(\rho_{n}\half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}+\nthkmean{m_{n}}\right) \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right]\\
            =\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \cdot \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}\cdot \boldsymbol{E}\right)
            &- \nthkmean{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nthkres{\eta}_{n+\half }\right)   \nthkres{m}_{n+1}}
            + \nthkmean{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nthkres{\eta}_{n-\half }\right) \nthkres{m}_{n}}.
          \end{split}
          \label{eddyenergy}
        \end{equation}
        Unfortunately, this equation is not entirely helpful as it
        introduces some triple correlations, or eddy-eddy interactions,
        namely $\thkmean{K_{n} \boldsymbol{u}_{n}}
        -\half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}
        \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}$ and 
        $\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{m_{n}\boldsymbol{u}_{n}}
        -\nthkmean{h_{n}} \nthkmean{m_{n}}\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}
         = \nthkmean{h_{n}m_{n}\boldsymbol{u}_{n}}
        -\nthkmean{h_{n}}\nthkmean{m_{n}}\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}$.
        Noting that $\thkmean{K_{n}} = \half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2} +
        \half \thkmean{\left|\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}}$
        we can further write that 
        $\thkmean{K_{n} \boldsymbol{u}_{n}}
        -\half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}
        \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} = \thkmean{\thkres{K}_{n} \thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}}
                +\half \thkmean{\left|\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}}
                \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}$. Similarly we
                also have 
                $\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{m_{n}\boldsymbol{u}_{n}}
                -\nthkmean{h_{n}} \nthkmean{m_{n}}\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}
                = 
                \nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{\nthkres{m}_{n}\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}}
                +\nthkmean{\nthkres{h}_{n} \nthkres{m}_{n}}\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}$.
                $\nthkmean{\nthkres{h}_{n} \nthkres{m}_{n}}$ is in some sense
                related to the eddy potential energy and hence we have
                an evolution equation for the eddy energy. This
                is, however, of limited use without making some assumptions about
                $\thkmean{\thkres{K}_{n} \thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}}$, 
                $\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{\nthkres{m}_{n}\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}}$ 
                and the vertical transfer of eddy energy, 
                $ \nthkmean{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nthkres{\eta}_{n-\half }\right) \nthkres{m}_{n}}$. 
                But if we could say something about these correlations
                then we would be able to determine the eddy energy of a system
                entirely from the mean dynamics.
                
              
              Potential enstophy is more straight-forward. The unweighted average of the
              conservative enstrophy equation,
              \begin{equation*}
              \partialdiff{t}\left(h_{n}Q_{n}\right)+\boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(h_{n}\boldsymbol{u}_{n}Q_{n}\right) = 0,
              \end{equation*}
              where $Q_{n} = \half q_{n}^{2}$ gives an
              enstrophy budget for the mean state,  
              \begin{equation*}
              \partialdiff{t}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{Q}_{n}\right)+\boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}_{n}Q_{n}}\right) = 0.
              \end{equation*}
              We can also write down an equation for the mean potential enstrophy,
              $\half \thkmean{q}_{n}^{2}$, as
              \begin{equation*}
               \partialdiff[\nthkmean{h_{n}} \half \thkmean{q}_{n}^{2}]{t}+   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \left(\nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \half \thkmean{q}_{n}^{2}\right) =-\thkmean{q}_{n} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left( \nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\thkres{q}_{n}} \right).
              \end{equation*}
              Subtracting these equations from one-another  we attain
              \begin{equation}
              \partialdiff[\nthkmean{h_{n}} \half \thkmean{{\thkres{q}_{n}}^{2}}]{t}+   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot \left(\nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \thkres{Q}_{n}}+\nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \half \thkmean{{\thkres{q}_{n}}^{2}}\right) =\thkmean{q}_{n} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left( \nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\thkres{q}_{n}} \right)
              \label{eddyenstrophy}
              \end{equation}
              Again we have a correlation, $\thkmean{\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \thkres{Q}_{n}}$, which causes problems; but if this
              can be ignored or parameterised in some other way then we
              would have an equation for the evolution
              of eddy potential enstrophy.
              
              The discussion of these equations is important since
              the structure of the Eliassen-Palm tensor is 
              dependent on the eddy energy and eddy potential enstrophy. 
              Hence, for a viable eddy parameterisation to be achieved
              from this theory a model must be able to 
              judge how much eddy energy and eddy potential enstrophy it has
              available. This can of course be done by prescribing the
               eddy energy and eddy potential enstrophy, but ideally 
               it would be useful to have a away of predicting these
               quantities from the dynamics of the system. What Equations~\eqref{eddyenergy}
               and \eqref{eddyenstrophy} demonstrate is how the eddy energy 
               and eddy enstrophy interact with the mean field through
               $\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n} \cdot \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}\cdot \boldsymbol{E}\right)$ and $\thkmean{q}_{n} \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left( \nthkmean{h_{n}} \thkmean{\thkres{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\thkres{q}_{n}} \right)$.
              
              
              In order to apply the theory in this section we need to define an
              averaging operator that correctly splits a field up into its mean
              and eddy components. There are a number of ways to do this. 
              The most \hl{legitimate?} way of achieving this is
              to average over a large ensemble of models where the eddy field in each
              ensemble member is in a different state. However, this method is 
              hugely computationally expensive, requiring a large number of 
              ensemble members to achieve an appropriate mean and eddy
              decomposition. Plus if the mean state of the system being modelled happens 
              to diverge between ensemble members then the ensemble mean stops being 
              representative of the mean state. Two other ways of decomposing
              the system into mean and eddy components is with temporal or spatial
              averages. Spatial means require a large domain to average over to be effective
              on their own and a certain amount of spatial symmetry; a 
              zonal average will have problems if the topography, for example,
              varies in the zonal direction. However, if there is
              a usable spatial symmetry, then it is possible to use
              an averaging operator that averages in both temporally and spatially
              without much of a loss in computational efficiency. However,
              for a temporal average to be valid the system needs to be in
              a statistically steady state. That is to say that over a long
              averaging window $\partial \mean{\phi} /\partial t \sim 0$ for any variable $\phi$
            in the system.
            
            Overall all we have highlighted how the eddy field interacts with the mean
            field, as well as a way of decomposing a model into its mean and eddy fields.
            The momentum equations emit an Eliassen-Palm flux tensor, which can
            be bounded by eddy energy and eddy potential enstrophy as proposed
            by \cite{marshall2012framework} and \cite{maddison2013eliassen}. 
            The energy and potential enstrophy equations are more complicated
            as the mean equations for the eddy component of these quantities,
            Equations~\eqref{eddyenergy} and \eqref{eddyenstrophy}, both contain
            triple correlations. However, the equations still demonstrate how
            the mean and eddy energy and potential enstrophy interact.
            To decompose a system into its mean and eddy components we will
            use spatial and temporal averages; the first requires a certain
            amount of spatial symmetry whilst the second requires the system to be
            in a statistically steady state. The greatest challenge of the analysis
            that is to follow is to create a model that allows the application of 
            these averages in to most efficient way possible.

\section{Model Discretisation}

Now that we have our governing equations, we need to solve them. To do this we
discretise the equations onto an Arakawa C-grid and then solve for future times
using the 3rd-order Adams-Bashforth scheme. Next, to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
 condition (\cite{courant1928partiellen}), the time-step and grid spacing must satisfy ${\Delta x}/{\Delta t} \leq c_{\max}$ where $\Delta x$ is the smallest grid spacing, $\Delta t$ is
 the time-step and $c_{\max}$ is the fastest speed at which information is propagated at. 
 In our equations this is the surface gravity wave speed, $\sqrt{g H}$, where $H$ is the
 maximum fluid depth. However, since the next fastest waves are the internal gravity
  waves with speeds of order $\sqrt{g_{n+\half} H}$, approximately $1000$ times slower than the surface gravity waves, it makes sense to suppress the surface gravity
  waves. To do this in such a way that is consistent with mass, momentum and energy 
  conservation, we impose the rigid-lid approximation. By imagining a flat plate 
  placed across the surface, we can re-interpret the pressure fluctuations from a free
  surface as the fluid pushing or pulling on the plate and the resulting force 
  applied to the fluid in reaction. 
  
  In practise, to apply the rigid-lid approximation we add a barotropic pressure
  gradient to the momentum equations. This corrects the time-stepped velocities 
  to ensure that conservation of mass is satisfied. Since the rigid-lid imposes a
  boundary above the fluid whilst the topography imposes a similar one below 
  we have that 
  \begin{equation}
  0=\frac{  \partial}{\partial t} \sum^{N}_{n=1} h_{n} = -
  \sum^{N}_{n=1} \left( \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (u_{n}h_{n} )+ 
  \frac{\partial }{\partial y} (v_{n}h_{n} ) \right) ,
  \end{equation}
  where $\left(u_n,v_n\right)=\left(u_n^{*},v^{*}_n\right)-\Delta t \boldsymbol{\nabla}p$
  is the corrected velocities, $p$ is the barotropic pressure correction,
  $\Delta t$~is~the time-step and
  $\left(u_n^{*},v^{*}_n\right)$ are the time-stepped velocities. This implies that to
  calculate $p$ we need to solve 
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{  \partial}{\partial x} \left( H \frac{  \partial p}{\partial x} \right) +
  \frac{  \partial}{\partial y} \left( H \frac{  \partial p}{\partial y} \right) =
  \sum^{N}_{n=1} \left( \frac{\partial }{\partial x} (u^{*}_{n}h_{n} )+ 
  \frac{\partial }{\partial y} (v^{*}_{n}h_{n} ) \right)
  \label{swbaropressureeq}
  \end{equation}
  where $H= \sum^{N}_{n=1} h_{n}$. The right hand side is known after time-stepping 
  and so \equref{swbaropressureeq} is simply an elliptic equation. This is solved using
  the conjugate gradient method to within a small tolerance. Since
  the discretised left hand side of \equref{swbaropressureeq} is sparse, the speed of the 
  conjugate gradient method can be improved by choosing an appropriate matrix.
  A choice that appears to make a reasonable improvement is the operation
  \begin{equation}
  \overline{\left(\overline{1/H}^{x} p\right) }^{x} + \overline{\left(\overline{1/H}^{y} p\right) }^{y}
  \end{equation}
  applied to $p$, where bars denote averaging in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively.
  
  Typical scales in the Arctic are $\sim 10 \mathrm{km}$ for
  the lateral scale of mesoscale eddies,
  $3-5 \mathrm{km}$ for ocean depth, whilst typical speeds are in
  $\mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, because of this we shall rescale the 
  dimensions so that the model is not operating with values of vastly different magnitudes
  and hence reducing the chance for floating point errors. Firstly, the layer thicknesses,
  $h_{n}$, are scaled by the mean depth of the topography so that 
  $ \int_{D} \left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} h_{n}\right)  \mathrm{ d A} / \int_{D} \mathrm{ d A} \equiv 1 $, 
  where $D$  is the domain, $N$ the number of layers and
  $ \mathrm{ d A} = \mathrm{ d x}\, \mathrm{ d y}$. 
  The first baroclinic deformation radius is approximately $L_{D}=\sqrt{g^{\prime}H}/f_{0}$,
  where ${g^{\prime}=g\left(\rho_{1}-\rho_{N}\right)}/\rho_{N}$ and $f_{0}$ is 
  the local Coriolis parameter, and sets the scale of the mesoscale eddies.
  Hence, we take ${g\left(\rho_{1}-\rho_{N}\right)}/\rho_{N} = 1 $
  and $f_{0}=1$ so that time is scaled by $1/f_{0}$ and the horizontal velocities and distances are scaled by the wave speed, $\sqrt{g^{\prime}H}$ and deformation radius, $L_{D}=\sqrt{g^{\prime}H}/f_{0}$.

  In order to have well resolved eddies, we choose a grid resolution of $ L_{D} / 20$
  meanwhile we want a domain that is at least around $10$ or $20$ times the 
  mesoscale. This immediately give around a hundred thousand degrees of freedom,
  since we are limited by available computation resources it is not sensible
  to have a large domain or finer grid that this. To cheat this limitation
  we use a doubly re-entrant domain rather than a basin with boundaries, exploiting
  the fact we would expect the ocean to be statistically similar across a symmetric 
  domain and avoiding the large domain required to incorporate an entire ocean basin's
  dynamics. This choice does have some obvious drawbacks. Firstly, the doubly-periodic symmetry is
  incredibly unrealistic, the ocean is not divided into identical cubes; and so the 
  fact that a piece of dynamics will have an identical neighbour nearby may cause some
  unrealistic properties. However, this will hopefully only be a problem on the largest 
  scales. Secondly, this requires a constant Coriolis parameter which may loose
  us some important dynamical processes such as Rossby waves; however, at high latitudes, the Coriolis parameter is nearly constant
  at leading order.
  Finally, there is a similar issue with topography, any choice must be
  translationally symmetric in both the zonal and meridional directions. This limits the choices to sea mounts and ridges.  
    
  Now, to generate dynamically interesting system we manipulate the system using 
  the forcing and
  dissipation terms, $\boldsymbol{F}_{\boldsymbol{u}} = \left(F_{u}, F_{v}\right)$ and $\boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{u}} = \left(D_{u}, D_{v}\right)$, in \equref{sweqs}.
  This is typically achieved by applying parameterisations for wind stress
  and bottom friction. An appropriate way to parameterise wind stress in terms of  
  relative velocity between the atmospheric velocity at $10 \mathrm{m}$ above sea-level
  and the sea surface velocity, for example as the quadratic stress
  \begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{\tau}=\rho_{a} c_{d} \left|\boldsymbol{U}_{10}-\boldsymbol{u}_{a}\right|
  \left(\boldsymbol{U}_{10}-\boldsymbol{u}_{a}\right),
  \end{equation}
  where $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is the surface wind stress, $\rho_{a}$ is the density of
  air at sea level, $c_{d}$ is the drag coefficient, $\boldsymbol{u}_{a}$ is the ocean
  surface velocity and $\boldsymbol{U}_{10}$ is the wind velocity
  at $10 \mathrm{m}$ above the sea surface.
  Whilst the importance of using the relative velocities is well established
  (\cite{duhaut2006wind}, \cite{zhai2007wind}, \cite{hughes2008wind}, \cite{zhai2012wind}); 
  however, consistent with the idealised framework in which we are 
  working in, we assume that $\left|\boldsymbol{u}_{a}\right| \ll \left|\boldsymbol{U}_{10}\right|$
  and $\boldsymbol{\tau}=\rho_{a} c_{d} \left|\boldsymbol{U}_{10}\right|
  \boldsymbol{U}_{10}$, which is simply a vector set by the 
  magnitude and direction of the wind.
   Since the momentum within each layer
  is defined to be constant with in each layer, the input of momentum from the wind
  is distributed through the layer giving ``$\left(F_{u_{N}},F_{v_{N}}\right)=\boldsymbol{\tau}/\left(\rho_{N}h_{N}\right) \equiv
  \left(\tau_{u},\tau_{v}\right)/\left(\rho_{N}h_{N}\right) $" in the
  uppermost layer, $n=N$. 
  
  Now that we have a mechanism to force the system we need a 
  mechanism of dissipating the 
  energy input from the winds. The most physically reasonable way to do this is to
   introduce bottom friction to the model. Bottom friction is a drag intended to represent 
  the shear stress felt by the ocean as it flows over the ocean floor; however,
  in a layered model, the bottom drag must be applied throughout
  the lowest layer. Since we want the bottom friction to remove momentum
  from the system, it seems sensible for it to be of the form $\boldsymbol{\tau} \propto
  - \boldsymbol{u}_{1}$, where $\boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ is the horizontal velocity
  in the bottom layer. A first guess might be a linear drag, similar to the wind stress,
  given by  $h_{1}\boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{u}_{1}} = - r \boldsymbol{u}_{1}$ for
  some parameter $r$. However, studies have shown (for example \cite{grianik2004effects} and
  \cite{arbic2008quadratic})
  that a straight-forward linear
  bottom friction gives rise to large, unrealistic eddies and that using a higher order
  polynomial gives more realistic results.
  One advantage of an $n$-polynomial bottom  friction rather than 
  a linear bottom friction is that it can be scale selective. By taking the 
  drag to have the form ``$\boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{u}_{1}} = 
  - r \left( \frac{ \left|\boldsymbol{u}_{1}\right| }
  {\left|\boldsymbol{u}^{\ast}\right|}\right)^{n}
  \boldsymbol{u}_{1}/h_{1}$" for some typical velocity $\boldsymbol{u}^{\ast}$, 
  natural number $n$ and friction coefficient $r$. Now for $n \geq 1$ (note that for $n=0$, this is 
  just linear bottom friction), $\boldsymbol{D}_{\boldsymbol{u}_{1}}$
  is stronger when $\left|\boldsymbol{u}_{1}\right| > \left|\boldsymbol{u}^{\ast}\right|$
  and weaker when $\left|\boldsymbol{u}_{1}\right| < \left|\boldsymbol{u}^{\ast}\right|$
  than in the linear case. Hence, the higher order polynomials limit the flows from 
  becoming too strong by selectively limiting the stronger currents.
  This means it is possible that, by tuning $r$, $\left|\boldsymbol{u}^{\ast}\right|$ and 
  $n$, a bottom friction can be chosen that limits the along-topography flow with
  minimal effect on the eddy field. 
  
  In order to tune these parameters, we will diagnose
  topostrophy which we introduced in \secref{arcticnumerics}
  defined as
  $\tau = \left(\boldsymbol{ f } \wedge
  \boldsymbol{ u } \right) \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} D $. 
  Topostrophy is a correlation between the flow velocity
  and contours of topography and hence, is a measure of how much the flow is
  following topography. With this tool we can explore the sensitivity of the models
  ability to generate along-topography flow to the choice of bottom friction. 
  Figure \ref{fig:topostrophy} shows the mean topostrophy for the
  initial spin up of several models with a topographic ridge similar to
  the schematics in \figref{fig:TopographySchem} and
	\figref{fig:TopographyCross}. The first thing to note is how damped the 
  topostrophy is in the linear
  bottom friction case. It is clear that the bottom friction is inhibiting the 
  eddies greatly and so stopping the formation of along-topography flows. In
  the quadratic cases, there is a lot more variability in the topostrophy, indicating
  that there is a much more active eddy field. However again, there is no obvious
  along-topography flow, meaning the bottom friction is still too broadly dissipative.
  It should however be noted that the lower layers have more positive topostrophy than
  the upper layers, indicating that there is some along topography flow in the lower 
  layers but that it's not being precipitated  through the water column
  The cubic drag models are much more interesting. The flow appears to have much more
  freedom to generate flows, whilst still being capped by $\left|\boldsymbol{u}^{\ast}\right|$. $\left|f\right| = 1$, $\boldsymbol{\nabla} D \sim 0.1$ and so $\left|\boldsymbol{u}\right| \sim 0.01 < \left|\boldsymbol{u}^{\ast}\right|$.
  Given these results it seems sensible to use the cubic parameterisation for bottom 
  friction. It's worth noticing that there is little physical rational for choosing
  one parameterisation over another, other than one might produce more physically 
  appealing results. Finally, we also require grid-scale dissipation. This is to dissipate the
  numerical noise which develops at the grid-scale from the cascade of enstophy.
  In these models we use biharmonic diffusion with the Smagorinsky viscosity (\cite{smagorinsky1963general}).

  		are shown by dotted, dashed and solid line respectively. Since

  		one plot is needed. }
  	\label{fig:topostrophy}
  \end{figure}
  
  In summary, we have created a model that is simple and fast to run, but still is a
  reasonable representation of the Arctic Ocean. Using this model, we can apply 
  averaging operators to diagnose eddy-mean interactions in the 
  presence of topography using the theory developed
  in \secref{eddymeantheory}. However, before we get to topography, let us convince
  ourselves that we have a model that is consistent the equations derived in
  Chapter~\ref{sweq} and our conception of ocean dynamics. 
  Using the wind stress that we will discuss in detail in \secref{stochwind} in
  a three-layered domain without topography we spin up a model to examine the 
  resulting eddy field and momentum and energy balances. 
  \equref{swlayercorrectenergy} demonstrates there is an energy that is conserved 
  except for forcing and dissipation, in this case due to
   the wind stress, bottom 
  friction and viscosity. In \figref{fig:notopenergy}, it
  is seen that 
  the bottom friction balances the energy input from the wind over a large time
  window beyond the initial spin up. \figref{fig:notoppv} shows a snapshot of the \gls{pv}
  field around $40 \times 10^{3}/f$ into the integration. The surface layer shows a strong eddy
  field with eddies around the scale of the deformation radius and some filamentation.
  The middle layer has basically uniform \gls{pv} as one would expect since 
  the only non-conservative term in the \gls{pv} equation for this layer is the
  viscosity, which is small. In the lowest layer the eddy field is mostly dissipated
  by the bottom friction, which is scale selective for strong flows leaving only shallow
  \gls{pv} gradients. This means there is slow and large scale barotropic flow
  present in all layers which whose magnitude is set by the bottom friction and spacial
  scale appears to be set by the domain size, whilst in there is a strong eddying 
  baroclinic flow whose spatial scale is set by the first baroclinic deformation radius
  and strength is set by the wind. In the time averaged mean, the variations of the
   \gls{pv} from the mean $f/h_{n}$ are vanishingly small, as shown in \figref{fig:notopmeanpv}, where with an averaging window of around $30 \times 10^{3}/f$
   the time-mean \gls{pv} varies by around $10 \%$ of the variability of the snapshot 
   \gls{pv} in \figref{fig:notoppv} whilst the time-mean flow speed is around $5 \%$.

\chapter{Analysis of a hierarchy of models}

Now that we have system that suits the needs that we outlined in the
introduction of Chapter~\ref{sweq} we can proceed with investigating the
role of mean-eddy flow interaction in the presence of topography.
As mentioned in the previous section, due choosing to have a doubly re-entrant
domain the choice of topography must be zonally and meridionally translationally symmetric.
Hence, we choose to have a zonal ridge as shown in the schematics
 \figref{fig:TopographySchem} as well as \figref{fig:TopographyCross}, which
 depicts a cross-section of the initial configuration of the domain where
 the layer thicknesses are chosen in such a way as to attempt reduce the chance of a
 layer outcropping by evenly distributing the layers above shallowest topography. Our
 understanding of eddy-topography interactions build from observational 
 data and experiments that were outlined in Chapter~\ref{intro} would lead us
 to expect an along topography flow to develop with an westward flow on the south side of
 the ridge, and an eastward flow on the north side of the ridge for a positive $f_{0}$.

\section{Zero-Mean Wind Stress}

\label{stochwind}

To begin, it seems most sensible to investigate the 
system with the simplest possible mean dynamics.
That is to say a system where the dynamical equations 
for the mean variables (for example \equref{swtwaeqs}) is 
only forced by the eddy-mean interaction and dissipation,
for example bottom friction. Of course, if the mean system is
only forced by the eddy-mean interactions and dissipative forces
then they only way interesting dynamics can occur
is through the eddy-mean interactions. Hence, we try to
generate an eddy field from some kind of forcing such that in the mean 
dynamics there is no contribution from the forcing, that is to say
that for forcing, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, we have $\thkmean{\boldsymbol{\tau}}\equiv0$.


To achieve such a system we introduce a spatially and temporally 
varying wind stress. There are a few  ways this can be done, a common method
is to generate a superposition of sine waves at various frequencies and 
phases as the stream function for the wind stress, this method is discussed at
length in \cite{koszalka2009dynamics} and \cite{brannigan2015seasonal}. 
Instead we populate the domain
with a collection of cyclones and       anticyclones. These, we define
in such a way that they each  independently give a circular wind
stress of a curtain maximum amplitude and that is vanishing small far from its centre,
with a continuous stream function      and curl. The profile shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:WindEg}
satisfies these conditions. It has five properties which can be altered to 
create a stress field which can be implemented in the model; these are it's
amplitude, radius, position, duration and orientation (i.e. whether it is cyclonic
or anticyclonic). By periodically generating these vortices with randomised properties
we can sum them together to create a wind stress which varies in time, and in the limit
of a long run time, the time-mean sums to zero. Each individual cyclone or anticyclone
has the form $\frac{1}{2\pi r}(1-e^{-r^{2}})e^{-r^{2}/2}\boldsymbol{e}_{\theta}$, where
at the wrap around points half the domain away from the vortex centre the vortex is tapered
rapidly to zero to avoid a discontinuity; here $r$ is the distance from the centre of the vortex, normalised by the
radius of the vortex, and $\boldsymbol{e}_{\theta}$ is the unit vector in the 
rotational direction. The vortices are also given a certain random duration, $t_{0}$, contained a minimum and maximum duration; the vortices then
grow and decline over this period in proportion to a sign wave in the range $[0,\pi]$.
Examples of how the full wind stress field looks at different
time steps are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:StochWind}. To further ensure a vanishing
mean wind stress over a long time averaging window we introduce the vortexes in cyclonic
and anti-cyclonic pairs of equal size and duration to ensure that the spatial mean
of the wind stress is precisely zero. 

Now we must check that this wind stress satisfies our needs. 
The upper bound of momentum contribution from
this wind stress to the time-averaged mean system is straight forward to calculate
and is dependent on ratio between the longest $t_{0}$, or vortex duration, 
and the averaging window. So for similar wind stresses the contribution to the mean system
is vanishingly small for longer averaging windows. The energy input is a little more
complicated; adding the wind forcing into the mean and eddy energy equations described 
in \secref{eddymeantheory} 
shows that applying the thickness weighted averaging operator to 
the energy equation, \equref{swtwameaneqenergy}, gives
$\nthkmean{\boldsymbol{\tau}}\cdot\nthkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}$ and  $\nthkmean{\nthkres{\boldsymbol{\tau}}\cdot\nthkres{\boldsymbol{u}}}$
as the energy input into the mean and eddy components of the system.
Taking averaging windows of $10^{3}/f$, \figref{fig:meaneddywind} shows
that the contribution to the mean component is vanishingly small 
and hence the wind stress suits our purpose by almost exclusively 
inputting energy and momentum into the eddy component of the system.

\section{Momentum and Energy Conservation}

Exploiting the symmetry of the ridge, we can average in the zonal direction 
as well as in time. This allows us to decompose the flow into mean field 
varying only in the meridional direction and an eddy field. 
Noting that $\partialdiff{x}\nthkmean{...}\equiv0$ for the zonal mean, we have that
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
	 \partialdiff[\thkmean{u}_{n}]{t}-(f+\spec{\zeta})\thkmean{v}_{n} 
	= -\nthkmean{h_{n}}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^{u}
	+\thkmean{F}_{u_{n}}-\thkmean{D}_{u_{n}}, \\
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	\partialdiff[\thkmean{v}_{n}]{t}+(f+\spec{\zeta})\thkmean{u}_{n} 
	= -   \frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}\nthkmean{m}_{n}+\half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}\right)
	-\nthkmean{h_{n}}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{3}\cdot\boldsymbol{E}^{v}
	+\thkmean{F}_{v_{n}}-\thkmean{D}_{v_{n}}, \\
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	0 =\frac{\partial \nthkmean{h_{n}} }{\partial t} +
	\frac{\partial  }{\partial y}\left(\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{ v_{n}}\right).\\
	\end{equation}
	where $\spec{\zeta}=-\partialdiff{\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}}{y}$ is
	the relative vorticity. The eddy stresses, $\boldsymbol{E}^{u}$, $\boldsymbol{E}^{v}$,
	become
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{array}{c}
	\boldsymbol{E}^{u}=\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	0 \\
	\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{\thkres{u}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}} \\
	0 \\
	\end{array}\right)+\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	0 \\
	0 \\
	\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{x}} \\
	\end{array}\right), \\ \\
	\boldsymbol{E}^{v}=\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	0 \\
	\nthkmean{h_{n}}\thkmean{\thkres{v}_{n}\thkres{v}_{n}} \\
	0 \\
	\end{array}\right)+\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	0\\
	\half\rho_{N}g_{n+\half} \nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}_{n+\half}\nthkres{\eta}_{n+\half}} \\
	\nthkmean{\nthkres{\eta}\nthkres{m}_{y}} \\
	\end{array}\right), \\
	\end{array}
	\end{equation}
	or as a tensor:
	\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{E}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	N & M + K + P& 0 \\
	R & S & 0 \\
	\end{array}\right).
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Hence in the steady state limit of $\partialdiff[\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}]{t} \xrightarrow{} 0$ over a long averaging window we have that $-(f+\spec{\zeta})\thkmean{v}_{n}$
balances the zonal eddy stresses, forcing and dissipation whilst 
 $(f+\spec{\zeta})\thkmean{u}_{n} +  \frac{\partial }{\partial y}\left(\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}\nthkmean{m_{n}}+\half \left|\thkmean{\boldsymbol{u}}_{n}\right|^{2}\right)$ balances the meridional 
 eddy stresses, forcing and dissipation. This can be used to demonstrate how the 
 wind driven eddy field interacts with the mean dynamics to generate an along topography
 flow. 
 
 Since the flow is mostly spun up well before $10.0\times10^{3}/f$ since initialisation, we take the time averaging window to be between $10.0\times10^{3}/f$ and $40.0\times10^{3}/f$, so $30.0\times10^{3}/f$ long; or assuming a latitude of around  $70^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ an
 averaging window of around $7.5$ years. 
 \figref{fig:umomlayer3} shows hows the eddy field interacts with mean dynamics 
 in two ways. Firstly, there are Reynolds stresses in the westward (negative) direction
 on the south side of the ridge and roughly equal Reynolds stresses in the eastward (positive) direction on the north side of the ridge. These Reynolds
 stresses are echoed in the lower layers, at least in sign if not shape or magnitude.
 This indicates an overall force from the eddy field in the direction of 
 positive topostrophy. Secondly, the eddy field also generates a form stress
 upon the lower layers which mostly balances the Reynolds stresses and drives
 momentum down into the lower layers. The residual of these two components is balanced
 by the mean Coriolis force, which is generated by a small meridional velocity.
 The negative sign south of the ridge and positive north of the ridge demonstrates
 a migration of fluid away from the ridge in the upper layer, hinting that perhaps
 the fluid isn't fully in a steady state and isopycnals are still increasing the 
 ``cold doming" effect above the ridge. In the central layer, shown in
 \figref{fig:umomlayer2}, the form stress inherited
 from the upper layer combines with a smaller Reynolds stress in the positive topostrophy
 direction whilst being balanced by the form stress between the central and lowest layer.
 The lowest layer, \figref{fig:umomlayer1}, has the form stresses built up in the 
 upper and middle layers mostly balancing the bottom friction, again
 there is a small Coriolis force signifying the flow onto the ridge. The bottom friction is 
 in opposition to a westward flow south of the ridge (hence positive) and an eastward
 flow north of the ridge (hence negative). This implies that over the entire
 water column, since the form stresses between layers must cancel each other, the 
 Reynolds stresses must balance the bottom friction by pushing the flow in the direction 
 of positive topostrophy as shown in \figref{fig:umomtotal}.

\hl{Model where the mean forcing is effectively zero. 
Hence the model is forced by a wind stress which is
absent from the mean system and hence forces the
system by 
invoking a turbulent cascade. Hence Eddy-Mean
interaction is entirely from the eddy to the mean.}

\section{\gls{pv} Conservation and Comparison of Mean \glspl{pv}}

\hl{An examination of the similarities and differences
of the two definitions of potential vorticity. 
A discussion of whether the thickness
weighted and tracer decomposition forms of the
PV eddy stresses can be used interchangeably.
This will be done by examining models with
different structures of potential vorticity.}


%\section{Strong Flow Models}

%more interesting situations, such as, models
%with a strong mean state, which hence
%generate there own eddy fields. E.g. Jets in
%channels or double gyres. Hopefully allowing 
%for the investigation of configurations where 
%Eddy Enstrophy is the constraining bound.


\chapter{Diagnostic Summary and Eddy-Mean Interaction Predictions}

Na\"{\i}ve attempt to parameterise eddies using the 
results from the previous chapters, depending
on what can be said about how the eddy stress can
be characterised and constrained by the topography,
eddy energy, eddy enstrophy etc. 

Likely will need to carry the time and spatial
evolution of eddy energy and eddy enstrophy and have
some sort of step function to turn on and off the
``GM like" and ``holloway like" parts of the parametrisation at appropriate moments.


\chapter{conclusions and discussions}

Summary of results.
Future work (keep this as unexplored possible ideas for now)
